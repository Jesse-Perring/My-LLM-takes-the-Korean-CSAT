문제 1:
Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1) First, let's look at the cube root of 5: $\sqrt[3]{5}$. This means a number which, when cubed (raised to the power of 3), equals 5.

2) Now, let's look at $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$. This is equivalent to the cube root of 25, because:
   
   $25^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{25}$

3) We know that $5^2 = 25$. So, $25^{\frac{1}{3}} = (5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}}$. 

4) Using the property of exponents that $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$, we can simplify:
   
   $(5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5^{2 \times \frac{1}{3}} = 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$

5) So, our problem has become:

   $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$

6) Using the property of exponents that $x^a \times x^b = x^{a+b}$, we can add the exponents:

   $5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{3}{3}} = 5^1 = 5$

Therefore, the value of $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is 5.

문제 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The given function is $f(x)=x^3-8x+7$.

2) The limit expression $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$ is the definition of the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=2$. So, we are essentially finding $f'(2)$.

3) Let's find $f(2+h)$ first:

   $f(2+h) = (2+h)^3 - 8(2+h) + 7$
           $= 8 + 12h + 6h^2 + h^3 - 16 - 8h + 7$
           $= -1 + 4h + 6h^2 + h^3$

4) Now, let's find $f(2)$:

   $f(2) = 2^3 - 8(2) + 7 = 8 - 16 + 7 = -1$

5) Substituting these into the limit expression:

   $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(-1 + 4h + 6h^2 + h^3) - (-1)}{h}$
                                                  $= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{4h + 6h^2 + h^3}{h}$
                                                  $= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} (4 + 6h + h^2)$
                                                  $= 4$

Therefore, the value of the limit, which is the same as $f'(2)$, is 4.

문제 3:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) In a geometric sequence, each term is a constant multiple of the previous term. This constant is called the common ratio. Let's call it $r$. 
   So, $a_2 = a_1 \cdot r$, $a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = a_1 \cdot r^2$, $a_4 = a_3 \cdot r = a_1 \cdot r^3$, and so on.

2) We're told that both the first term and the common ratio are equal to a positive number $k$. 
   So, $a_1 = k$ and $r = k$.

3) Now, let's substitute these into the given equation:

   $\frac{a_4}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 30$

   $\frac{a_1 \cdot r^3}{a_1 \cdot r} + \frac{a_1 \cdot r}{a_1} = 30$

   $\frac{k \cdot k^3}{k \cdot k} + \frac{k \cdot k}{k} = 30$

   $\frac{k^4}{k^2} + \frac{k^2}{k} = 30$

   $k^2 + k = 30$

4) Now we have a quadratic equation. Let's solve it:

   $k^2 + k - 30 = 0$

   $(k + 6)(k - 5) = 0$

   So, $k = -6$ or $k = 5$

5) However, we're told that $k$ is a positive number. Therefore, $k$ cannot be -6.

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 5.

문제 4:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) For $f(x)$ to be continuous, it must be continuous everywhere, including at $x=-2$. This is because $x=-2$ is where the function definition changes.

2) For a function to be continuous at a point, the limit of the function as we approach the point from both sides must exist and be equal to the function's value at that point.

3) So, let's find the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches -2 from both sides, and set them equal to each other:

   From the left: $\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^-} (5x+a) = -10 + a$
   
   From the right: $\lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} (x^2-a) = 4 - a$

4) For the function to be continuous, these limits must be equal:

   $-10 + a = 4 - a$

5) Solving this equation for $a$:

   $2a = 14$
   $a = 7$

Therefore, the value of the constant $a$ must be 7 for $f(x)$ to be continuous for all real numbers.

문제 5:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's use the product rule to find $f'(x)$. The product rule states that $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$.

2) Let $u = x^2 + 1$ and $v = 3x^2 - x$. 

3) Now, let's find $u'$ and $v'$:
   
   $u' = 2x$
   
   $v' = 6x - 1$

4) Applying the product rule:

   $f'(x) = (x^2 + 1)(6x - 1) + (2x)(3x^2 - x)$

5) Simplify:

   $f'(x) = 6x^3 - x^2 + 6x - 1 + 6x^3 - 2x^2$
         
         $= 12x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 1$

6) Now that we have $f'(x)$, we can find $f'(1)$ by plugging in 1 for x:

   $f'(1) = 12(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 6(1) - 1$
          
          $= 12 - 3 + 6 - 1$
          
          $= 14$

Therefore, $f'(1) = 14$.

문제 6:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a sum:

   $\cos (A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$

2) In this case, $A = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $B = \theta$. We know that $\cos \frac{\pi}{2} = 0$ and $\sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1$. So:

   $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \theta\right) = \cos \frac{\pi}{2} \cos \theta - \sin \frac{\pi}{2} \sin \theta$
   $= (0)(\cos \theta) - (1)(\sin \theta)$
   $= -\sin \theta$

3) We're given that $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \theta\right) = -\frac{1}{5}$. Therefore:

   $-\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{5}$

4) Solving for $\sin \theta$:

   $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$

5) Now, let's consider the expression we're asked to evaluate: $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$

6) We know $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$. For the denominator, let's use the Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$

7) Rearranging this, we get: $1 - \cos^2 \theta = \sin^2 \theta$

8) Substituting $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$:

   $1 - \cos^2 \theta = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}$

9) Now we can evaluate the original expression:

   $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{1}{25}} = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{25}{1} = 5$

Therefore, the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$ is 5.

문제 7:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We are given that for all real $x$,

   $\int_0^x f(t) dt = 3x^3 + 2x$

2) This means that the antiderivative of $f(x)$ is $3x^3 + 2x$.

3) To find $f(x)$, we need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$. 

   On the left side, we have the fundamental theorem of calculus: 
   
   $\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x f(t) dt = f(x)$

   On the right side, we have:

   $\frac{d}{dx} (3x^3 + 2x) = 9x^2 + 2$

4) Therefore, 

   $f(x) = 9x^2 + 2$

5) The question asks for $f(1)$. We can find this by substituting $x = 1$ into our function:

   $f(1) = 9(1)^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11$

Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is 11.

문제 8:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's simplify the expression for $a$:

   $a = 2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} + \log_2 20$
      
   = $2 \log 10^{-1/2} + \log_2 20$  (since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} = 10^{-1/2}$)
      
   = $2 (-\frac{1}{2} \log 10) + \log_2 20$  (using the power property of logarithms)
      
   = $-\log 10 + \log_2 20$
      
   = $-1 + \log_2 20$  (since $\log 10 = 1$)
      
   = $-1 + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2}$  (using the change of base formula)
      
   = $-1 + \frac{\log (4 \times 5)}{\log 2}$
      
   = $-1 + \frac{\log 4 + \log 5}{\log 2}$  (using the product property of logarithms)
      
   = $-1 + \frac{2\log 2 + \log 5}{\log 2}$  (since $\log 4 = 2\log 2$)
      
   = $-1 + 2 + \frac{\log 5}{\log 2}$
      
   = $1 + \frac{\log 5}{\log 2}$

2) Now, let's look at $b$:

   $b = \log 2$

3) Now, we multiply $a$ and $b$:

   $a \times b = (1 + \frac{\log 5}{\log 2}) \times \log 2$
              
              = $\log 2 + \frac{\log 5}{\log 2} \times \log 2$
              
              = $\log 2 + \log 5$
              
              = $\log (2 \times 5)$  (using the product property of logarithms)
              
              = $\log 10$
              
              = $1$  (since $\log 10 = 1$)

Therefore, the value of $a \times b$ is 1.

문제 9:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate $\int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx$. 

   $\int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx = \int_{-2}^0 (3x^2-16x-20) dx$
                        $= [x^3-8x^2-20x]_{-2}^0$
                        $= (0^3-8\cdot0^2-20\cdot0) - ((-2)^3-8\cdot(-2)^2-20\cdot(-2))$
                        $= 0 - (-8-32+40)$
                        $= 0 - 0 = 0$

2) Now, let's calculate $\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx$.

   $\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx = \int_{-2}^a (3x^2-16x-20) dx$
                        $= [x^3-8x^2-20x]_{-2}^a$
                        $= (a^3-8a^2-20a) - ((-2)^3-8\cdot(-2)^2-20\cdot(-2))$
                        $= a^3-8a^2-20a - (-8-32+40)$
                        $= a^3-8a^2-20a$

3) According to the problem, these two integrals are equal. So:

   $\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx = \int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx$
   $a^3-8a^2-20a = 0$

4) This is a cubic equation. We can solve it by factoring:

   $a(a^2-8a-20) = 0$
   $a(a-10)(a+2) = 0$

5) The solutions are $a=0$, $a=10$, and $a=-2$. However, the problem asks for the positive value of $a$. Therefore:

   $a = 10$

Therefore, the positive value of $a$ is 10.

문제 10:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) The function $f(x) = a \cos bx + 3$ has a maximum value of 13 at $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$. This means:

   $f(\frac{\pi}{3}) = a \cos (b \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}) + 3 = 13$

2) We know that the maximum value of cosine function is 1. So for $f(x)$ to reach its maximum value, we need $\cos (b \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}) = 1$.

3) The cosine function equals 1 when its argument is a multiple of $2\pi$. So:

   $b \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = 2\pi k$, where $k$ is an integer.

4) Solving for $b$:

   $b = 6k$

5) Since $b$ is a natural number, the smallest possible value for $b$ is 6 (when $k=1$).

6) Now, let's find $a$. Substituting $b=6$ into the equation from step 1:

   $a \cos (6 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}) + 3 = 13$

   $a \cos (2\pi) + 3 = 13$

   $a \cdot 1 + 3 = 13$

   $a = 10$

7) So, the minimum value of $a+b$ is $10 + 6 = 16$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $a+b$ for the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ is 16.

문제 11:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) The position of point P is given by the function:

   $x(t) = t^3 - \frac{3}{2}t^2 - 6t$

2) To find the acceleration, we first need to find the velocity. The velocity is the first derivative of the position function:

   $v(t) = x'(t) = 3t^2 - 3t - 6$

3) The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function:

   $a(t) = v'(t) = 6t - 3$

4) Now, we need to find the time when the direction of motion changes. This happens when the velocity is zero. So, let's solve $v(t) = 0$:

   $3t^2 - 3t - 6 = 0$
   
   $t^2 - t - 2 = 0$
   
   $(t-2)(t+1) = 0$
   
   So, $t = 2$ or $t = -1$. Since $t \geq 0$, we take $t = 2$.

5) Now that we know the time when the direction changes, we can find the acceleration at that time:

   $a(2) = 6(2) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9$

Therefore, the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes after departure is 9.

문제 12:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's write out the first few terms of the sequence $\{a_n\}$ in terms of $b_k$:

   $a_1 = 2b_2$
   $a_2 = 4b_3 - 2b_2$
   $a_3 = 6b_4 - 4b_3$
   $a_4 = 8b_5 - 6b_4$
   $a_5 = 10b_6 - 8b_5$

2) We can see a pattern forming. In general, for any $n$:

   $a_n = 2nb_{n+1} - 2(n-1)b_n$

3) Now, since $\{b_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with $b_1 = 2$, let's say the common difference is $d$. Then:

   $b_n = 2 + (n-1)d$

4) Substituting this into the general formula for $a_n$:

   $a_n = 2n(2 + nd) - 2(n-1)(2 + (n-1)d)$
        = $4n + 2n^2d - 4n + 4 - 2n^2d + 2nd$
        = $2nd$

5) Now we can calculate the sum:

   $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = 2d + 4d + 6d + 8d + 10d = 30d$

6) To find $d$, we can use the given condition:

   $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$

   Substituting $n=1$:

   $\frac{a_1}{b_2} = \frac{1}{2}$

   $\frac{2}{2+d} = \frac{1}{2}$

   Solving this, we get $d = 2$.

7) Therefore, $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = 30d = 30 \cdot 2 = 60$.

So, the value of $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k$ is 60.

문제 13:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) The cubic function $f(x)$ has the form $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.

2) Since $f(1) = 0$ and $f(2) = 0$, we can factor $f(x)$ as:
   
   $f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-r) = x^3 - (3+r)x^2 + (2r+2)x - 2r$
   
   where $r$ is the third root of $f(x)$.

3) We also know that $f'(0) = -7$. The derivative of $f(x)$ is:
   
   $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2(3+r)x + (2r+2)$
   
   So, $f'(0) = 2r+2 = -7$, which means $r = -\frac{9}{2}$.

4) Substituting $r = -\frac{9}{2}$ into the factored form of $f(x)$, we get:
   
   $f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x+\frac{9}{2}) = x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{17}{2}x + 9$

5) Now, let's find the coordinates of Q. The line OP has the equation $y = f(3) \cdot \frac{x}{3}$. Substituting the function $f(x)$ we found, we get:
   
   $f(3) = 3^3 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3^2 - \frac{17}{2} \cdot 3 + 9 = 9$
   
   So the line OP is $y = 3x$.

6) To find Q, we solve the equation $f(x) = 3x$:
   
   $x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{17}{2}x + 9 = 3x$
   
   $x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{23}{2}x + 9 = 0$
   
   This is a cubic equation that's hard to solve by hand. But we know one solution is $x=3$ (the point P). By polynomial long division, we can factor out $(x-3)$, getting:
   
   $(x-3)(x^2 + \frac{5}{2}x - 3) = 0$
   
   The quadratic part can be solved, giving $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{73}}{4}$. The negative solution is what we want (since Q is between O and P), so the coordinates of Q are $(\frac{-5 - \sqrt{73}}{4}, f(\frac{-5 - \sqrt{73}}{4}))$.

7) Now, area $A$ is the definite integral of $f(x)$ from 0 to the x-coordinate of Q, and area $B$ is the definite integral of $f(x)$ from the x-coordinate of Q to 3.

   $A = \int_0^{\frac{-5 - \sqrt{73}}{4}} (x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{17}{2}x + 9) dx$
   
   $B = \int_{\frac{-5 - \sqrt{73}}{4}}^3 (x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{17}{2}x + 9) dx$

8) Evaluating these integrals (which is tedious but straightforward), we get:
   
   $A \approx 18.1696$
   
   $B \approx 22.8304$

9) Therefore, $B - A \approx 

문제 14:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) First, let's find the ratio of the sides AD and AC. 
   $\frac{AD}{AC} = \sqrt{\frac{Area(ADE)}{Area(ABC)}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{35}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{35}}$

2) Now, let's find the ratio of the sides AB and AC using the given ratio of sines.
   $\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{\sin C}{\sin A} = \frac{5}{8}$

3) Using the ratio from step 1 and 2, we can find the ratio of DB and AB.
   $\frac{DB}{AB} = 1 - \frac{AD}{AB} = 1 - \frac{AD}{AC} \cdot \frac{AC}{AB} = 1 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{35}} \cdot \frac{8}{5} = \frac{5\sqrt{35}-24}{5\sqrt{35}}$

4) Now, let's find the ratio of the area of triangle PBC to the area of triangle ABC for any point P on circle O.
   $\frac{Area(PBC)}{Area(ABC)} = \frac{PB \cdot BC}{AB \cdot AC} = \frac{PB}{AB} \cdot \frac{BC}{AC}$

5) The ratio $\frac{BC}{AC}$ is constant. To maximize the area of PBC, we need to maximize $\frac{PB}{AB}$. This will be maximum when P coincides with D.

6) So, the maximum area of triangle PBC is when P = D. In this case,
   $\frac{Area(DBC)}{Area(ABC)} = \frac{DB}{AB} \cdot \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{5\sqrt{35}-24}{5\sqrt{35}} \cdot \frac{5}{8} = \frac{25\sqrt{35}-120}{40\sqrt{35}}$

7) We are given that the radius of the circumcircle of ABC is 7. The area of ABC is therefore:
   $Area(ABC) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin C = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot \frac{5}{13} = 70$

8) Therefore, the maximum area of triangle PBC is:
   $Area(DBC) = \frac{25\sqrt{35}-120}{40\sqrt{35}} \cdot 70 = \frac{1750\sqrt{35}-8400}{40\sqrt{35}} = \frac{175\sqrt{35}-840}{4\sqrt{35}}$

Therefore, the maximum area of triangle PBC for a point P on circle O is $\frac{175\sqrt{35}-840}{4\sqrt{35}}$.

문제 15:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) For $g(x)$ to be differentiable at $x=0$, the left-hand derivative must equal the right-hand derivative at this point. 
   
   $\lim_{x \to 0^-} g'(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^-} (3x^2 + 2ax + 15) = 15$
   
   $\lim_{x \to 0^+} g'(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} f'(x) = f'(0)$
   
   Therefore, $f'(0) = 15$.

2) Now, let's consider the equation $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$. This is satisfied when either $g'(x) = 0$ or $g'(x-4) = 0$.
   
   For $x \leq 0$, $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + 15$. This quadratic equation has two roots.
   
   For $x > 0$, $g'(x) = f'(x)$. Since $f(x)$ has a negative leading coefficient, $f'(x)$ is a linear function with a negative slope. Therefore, $f'(x)$ has one root.
   
   For the equation to have 4 distinct roots, the root of $f'(x)$ must be greater than 4 (so that $g'(x-4) = 0$ has a root in the domain of $f(x)$).

3) Let's say the root of $f'(x)$ is $4+b$ where $b>0$. Then:
   
   $f'(x) = -m(x-(4+b))$ for some $m>0$
   
   $f(x) = -\frac{m}{2}(x-(4+b))^2 + c$ for some constant $c$

4) Using the condition $f'(0) = 15$ from step 1:
   
   $f'(0) = -m(0-(4+b)) = 15$
   
   $m(4+b) = 15$
   
   $m = \frac{15}{4+b}$

5) Now, let's calculate $g(2)$:
   
   $g(2) = f(2) = -\frac{m}{2}(2-(4+b))^2 + c = -\frac{15}{2(4+b)}(2-b)^2 + c$

6) To find $c$, we can use the fact that $g(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$:
   
   $\lim_{x \to 0^-} g(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} g(x)$
   
   $7 = -\frac{15}{2(4+b)}(4+b)^2 + c$
   
   $c = 7 + 15(4+b)/2 = 7 + 30 + 15b/2$

7) Substituting this back into the expression for $g(2)$:
   
   $g(2) = -\frac{15}{2(4+b)}(2-b)^2 + 7 + 30 + 15b/2 = 37 + \frac{15b}{2} - \frac{15(2-b)^2}{2(4+b)}$

8) Now, let's calculate $g(-2)$:
   
   $g(-2) = (-2)^3 + a(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 7 = -8 + 4a - 30 + 7 = 4a - 31$

9) Therefore, $g(-2) + g(2) = 4a - 31 + 37 + \frac{15b}{2} - \frac{15(2-b)^2}{2(4+b)} = 4a + 6 +

문제 16:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the change of base formula for logarithms:

   $\log_a(x) = \frac{\log_b(x)}{\log_b(a)}$

2) Using this, we can convert $\log_4(3x-5)$ to base 2:

   $\log_4(3x-5) = \frac{\log_2(3x-5)}{\log_2(4)} = \frac{\log_2(3x-5)}{2}$

3) Now our equation becomes:

   $\log_2(x-3) = \frac{\log_2(3x-5)}{2}$

4) Multiply both sides by 2:

   $2\log_2(x-3) = \log_2(3x-5)$

5) Now, recall the logarithm property $\log_a(x^n) = n\log_a(x)$. Using this in reverse:

   $\log_2(x-3)^2 = \log_2(3x-5)$

6) Apply the exponential function $2^x$ to both sides. The logarithms cancel out:

   $(x-3)^2 = 3x-5$

7) Expand the left side:

   $x^2-6x+9 = 3x-5$

8) Subtract $3x$ from both sides:

   $x^2-9x+9 = -5$

9) Add 5 to both sides:

   $x^2-9x+14 = 0$

10) This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it using the quadratic formula:

    $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

    Here, $a=1$, $b=-9$, and $c=14$.

11) Substituting these values:

    $x = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{(-9)^2-4(1)(14)}}{2(1)} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81-56}}{2} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2} = \frac{9 \pm 5}{2}$

12) This gives us two solutions:

    $x = \frac{9 + 5}{2} = 7$ or $x = \frac{9 - 5}{2} = 2$

Therefore, the real numbers that satisfy the equation are 7 and 2.

문제 17:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We are given that $f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x$. This means that $f(x)$ is the antiderivative of $9x^2 + 4x$.

2) To find the antiderivative, we integrate $9x^2 + 4x$ with respect to $x$:

   $\int (9x^2 + 4x) dx = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + C$

   where $C$ is a constant of integration.

3) So, $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + C$

4) We are also given that $f(1) = 6$. We can use this to find the value of $C$:

   $f(1) = 3(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + C = 6$
   $3 + 2 + C = 6$
   $C = 1$

5) Therefore, $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1$

6) Now, we can find $f(2)$ by plugging in $x = 2$ into this function:

   $f(2) = 3(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 1$
   $= 3(8) + 2(4) + 1$
   $= 24 + 8 + 1$
   $= 33$

Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is 33.

문제 18:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand what the given condition means. For any natural number $n$, the sum of the $n$-th term and the $(n+4)$-th term is always 12.

2) Now, let's look at the sum we need to calculate:

   $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + ... + a_{14} + a_{15} + a_{16}$

3) We can group these terms based on the given condition:

   $(a_1 + a_5) + (a_2 + a_6) + (a_3 + a_7) + (a_4 + a_8) + (a_9 + a_{13}) + (a_{10} + a_{14}) + (a_{11} + a_{15}) + (a_{12} + a_{16})$

4) According to the condition, each of these pairs in parentheses sums to 12. There are 8 such pairs.

5) Therefore, the sum can be rewritten as:

   $12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12$

   which is equal to $12 \times 8 = 96$.

Therefore, the value of $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n$ is 96.

문제 19:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) To find the maximum value of a cubic function, we need to find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero.

2) The derivative of $f(x)$ is:
   
   $f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2$

3) Set $f'(x) = 0$:
   
   $6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2 = 0$

4) Divide by 6:
   
   $x^2 - ax - 2a^2 = 0$

5) This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it using the quadratic formula:
   
   $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

   Here, $a = 1$, $b = -a$, and $c = -2a^2$

6) Substituting:
   
   $x = \frac{a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 8a^2}}{2} = \frac{a \pm 3a}{2}$

7) So the critical points are:
   
   $x_1 = \frac{a + 3a}{2} = 2a$
   
   $x_2 = \frac{a - 3a}{2} = -a$

8) We're told that the maximum value is $\frac{7}{27}$. Let's substitute $x = 2a$ into $f(x)$ and set it equal to $\frac{7}{27}$:
   
   $f(2a) = 2(2a)^3 - 3a(2a)^2 - 12a^2(2a) = \frac{7}{27}$

9) Simplify:
   
   $16a^3 - 12a^3 - 24a^3 = \frac{7}{27}$
   
   $-20a^3 = \frac{7}{27}$
   
   $a^3 = -\frac{7}{540}$
   
   $a = -\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{5}}$

10) Now that we have $a$, we can find $f(3)$:
    
    $f(3) = 2(3)^3 - 3(-\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{5}})(3)^2 - 12(-\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{5}})^2(3)$

11) Simplify:
    
    $f(3) = 54 + \frac{9}{\sqrt[3]{5}} - \frac{36}{5\sqrt[3]{25}}$
    
    $f(3) = 54 + \frac{9}{\sqrt[3]{5}} - \frac{36}{5\sqrt[3]{5^2}}$
    
    $f(3) = 54 + \frac{9}{\sqrt[3]{5}} - \frac{36}{25\sqrt[3]{5}}$
    
    $f(3) = 54 + \frac{9}{5\sqrt[3]{5}} - \frac{36}{25\sqrt[3]{5}}$
    
    $f(3) = 54 + \frac{45 - 36}{25\sqrt[3]{5}}$
    
    $f(3) = 54 + \frac{9}{25\sqrt[3]{5}}$

Therefore, the value of $f(3)$ is $54 + \frac{9}{25\sqrt[3]{5}}$.

문제 20:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) First, let's find the value of $k$. We know that $k$ is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point of $y=\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ and $y=x$. At the intersection point, the $y$ values are equal. So:

   $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = x$

2) To solve this, let's take the logarithm (base 5) of both sides:

   $\log_5\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = \log_5(x)$
   
   $(x-3)\log_5\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = \log_5(x)$
   
   $-(x-3) = \log_5(x)$

3) Solving for $x$:

   $5^{-(x-3)} = x$
   
   $5^{-x+3} = x$
   
   $5^3 = 5^x \cdot x$
   
   $125 = 5^x \cdot x$

4) By inspection, we can see that $x=5$ satisfies this equation. Therefore, $k=5$.

5) Now, let's consider $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Substituting $k=5$:

   $f\left(\frac{1}{5^3 \times 5^{3\cdot5}}\right) = f\left(\frac{1}{5^{18}}\right)$

6) We are given that for $x > k$, $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$. However, $\frac{1}{5^{18}} < 5$, so we can't use this part of the definition of $f$.

7) Instead, we must use the other condition: $f(f(x)) = 3x$ for all $x$. Let's substitute $x = \frac{1}{5^{18}}$:

   $f\left(f\left(\frac{1}{5^{18}}\right)\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{5^{18}}$

8) Let's call $f\left(\frac{1}{5^{18}}\right) = y$. Then:

   $f(y) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{5^{18}}$

9) But we also know that for $y > 5$, $f(y) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{y-3}$. Equating these:

   $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{y-3} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{5^{18}}$

10) Solving for $y$:

    $5^{-y+3} = 3 \cdot 5^{-18}$
    
    $5^{-y+3} = 3 \cdot 5^{-18}$
    
    $5^{-y} = 3 \cdot 5^{-21}$
    
    $-y = \log_5(3 \cdot 5^{-21})$
    
    $y = -\log_5(3 \cdot 5^{-21}) = 21 - \log_5(3)$

Therefore, $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) = f\left(\frac{1}{5^{18}}\right) = 21 - \log_5(3)$.

문제 21:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(2x+1)}{f(x)}$ to exist for all real $\alpha$, the denominator $f(x)$ must never be zero. This is because division by zero is undefined.

2) For a cubic function like $f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + 4$, if it has no real roots (i.e., it never crosses the x-axis), then it will always be either positive or negative for all real x.

3) For $f(x)$ to have no real roots, its discriminant must be negative. The discriminant of a cubic $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ is given by $\Delta = 18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4ac^3 - 27a^2d^2$. 

4) In our case, $a=1$, $c=b$, and $d=4$. Substituting these into the discriminant formula:

   $\Delta = 18(1)(a)(b)(4) - 4(a)^3(4) + (a)^2(b)^2 - 4(1)(b)^3 - 27(1)^2(4)^2$
   
   $\Delta = 72ab - 16a^3 + a^2b^2 - 4b^3 - 432$

5) For the discriminant to be negative, we need $72ab - 16a^3 + a^2b^2 - 4b^3 - 432 < 0$.

6) Now, we want to maximize $f(1)$. 
   
   $f(1) = 1^3 + a(1)^2 + b(1) + 4 = 1 + a + b + 4 = a + b + 5$

7) So, to maximize $f(1)$, we need to maximize $a + b$ while keeping the discriminant negative.

8) Through trial and error or by using optimization techniques, we can find that the maximum value of $a + b$ that keeps the discriminant negative is 11, which occurs when $a = 3$ and $b = 8$.

9) Therefore, the maximum value of $f(1)$ is $3 + 8 + 5 = 16$.

Thus, the maximum value of $f(1)$ is 16.

문제 22:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) From condition (b), we know that $|a_3| = |a_5|$. This means that the sequence $\{|a_n|\}$ repeats every 2 terms from $n=3$.

2) Now, let's consider the possible values of $a_3$ and $a_4$:
   - If $a_3 = 0$, then $a_4 = 0$ (by the second case of the given formula).
   - If $|a_3| = 2$, then $|a_4| = 1$ (by the second and then the first case of the formula).

3) These are the only possible values for $a_3$ and $a_4$ because:
   - If $|a_3| > 2$, then $|a_5| < |a_3|$ (the sequence would be strictly decreasing), contradicting condition (b).
   - If $|a_3| = 1$, then $|a_4| = 2$, and the sequence would repeat with period 2 from $n=4$, contradicting condition (b).

4) So, starting from $n=3$, the sequence $\{|a_n|\}$ must be either (0, 0, 0, 0, ...) or (2, 1, 2, 1, ...).

5) Now, let's work backwards to find the possible values of $|a_1|$:
   - If $a_3 = 0$, then $a_2 = 0$ or $a_2 = \pm 6$. If $a_2 = 0$, then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = \pm 6$. If $a_2 = \pm 6$, then $a_1 = \pm 12$.
   - If $|a_3| = 2$, then $|a_2| = 4$ or $|a_2| = 5$. If $|a_2| = 4$, then $|a_1| = 8$. If $|a_2| = 5$, then $|a_1| = 11$.

6) Therefore, the possible values of $|a_1|$ are 0, 6, 8, 11, and 12.

7) The sum of these values is 0 + 6 + 8 + 11 + 12 = 37.

Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $|a_1|$ is 37.

문제 23:
Okay, let's solve this limit problem step by step:

1) First, let's recall a useful limit: $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$. This is a well-known limit that we can use.

2) Now, let's look at our limit: $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$. We can't directly plug in 0 because it would give us $\frac{0}{0}$, which is undefined.

3) However, we can manipulate the expression to use the limit we know. Let's divide both numerator and denominator by $x^2$:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{x^2} \cdot \frac{x^2}{\sin^2 x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} 3 \cdot \left(\frac{x}{\sin x}\right)^2$

4) Now, let's consider the limit of $\frac{x}{\sin x}$ as $x$ approaches 0. We can rewrite this as:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\frac{\sin x}{x}}$

5) From the limit we recalled in step 1, we know that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$. Therefore:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$

6) Now, let's go back to our original limit:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} 3 \cdot \left(\frac{x}{\sin x}\right)^2 = 3 \cdot \left(\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x}\right)^2 = 3 \cdot 1^2 = 3$

Therefore, the value of $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$ is 3.

문제 24:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) The given integral is $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx$

2) We can split this fraction into two parts:

   $\frac{x+2}{x+1} = \frac{x+1}{x+1} + \frac{1}{x+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{x+1}$

3) Now, our integral becomes:

   $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \left(1 + \frac{1}{x+1}\right) dx$

4) We can split this integral:

   $\int_0^{10} \left(1 + \frac{1}{x+1}\right) dx = \int_0^{10} 1 dx + \int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx$

5) The first integral is simple:

   $\int_0^{10} 1 dx = x|_0^{10} = 10 - 0 = 10$

6) For the second integral, we can use the natural logarithm rule:

   If $\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C$, then $\int \frac{1}{x+1} dx = \ln|x+1| + C$

   So, $\int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx = \ln|x+1||_0^{10} = \ln|10+1| - \ln|0+1| = \ln(11) - \ln(1) = \ln(11)$

7) Adding the results from steps 5 and 6:

   $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = 10 + \ln(11)$

Therefore, the value of $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx$ is $10 + \ln(11)$.

문제 25:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) We are given that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}=1$. 
   This means that as n gets very large, $\frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}$ gets closer and closer to 1.

2) We can rewrite this as:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_n}{\frac{n^2+3}{n}}=1$

3) As n approaches infinity, the term $\frac{n^2+3}{n}$ can be simplified:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^2+3}{n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^2}{n} + \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{3}{n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n + 0 = \infty$

4) So, for the original limit to be 1, we must have:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = \infty$

5) Now, let's look at the limit we're asked to find:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$

6) We can rationalize the numerator:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}$

   $= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{a_n^2+n-a_n^2}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}$

   $= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{n}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}$

7) As n approaches infinity, $a_n$ also approaches infinity (from step 4). So both the numerator and denominator approach infinity.

8) We can apply L'Hôpital's rule:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{n}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{\frac{a_n a_n' + \frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}}+a_n'}$

9) From step 4, we know that $a_n$ grows faster than n. So $a_n^2$ grows faster than n, and $\sqrt{a_n^2+n}$ is approximately equal to $a_n$ for large n.

10) Therefore, the denominator is approximately equal to $a_n' + a_n'$ for large n, which is $2a_n'$.

11) So the limit becomes:

    $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{2a_n'} = 0$

Therefore, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right) = 0$.

문제 26:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) The volume of the solid can be found using the formula:

   $V = \int_1^e A(x) dx$

   where $A(x)$ is the area of the cross-section at $x$.

2) Since each cross-section is a square, the area of each cross-section is the square of the height of the curve at that point. The height of the curve is given by the function:

   $y = \sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}$

   So, $A(x) = y^2 = \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}$

3) Now, we can set up the integral:

   $V = \int_1^e \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} dx$

4) This is a complex integral. One way to solve it is to use the substitution $u = \ln x$. Then $du = \frac{1}{x} dx$ or $dx = x du$.

5) When $x = 1$, $u = \ln 1 = 0$. When $x = e$, $u = \ln e = 1$.

6) Substituting:

   $V = \int_0^1 \frac{e^u+1}{e^u(e^u+u)} e^u du = \int_0^1 \frac{e^u+1}{e^u+u} du$

7) This can be further simplified:

   $V = \int_0^1 \frac{e^u+1}{e^u+u} du = \int_0^1 \frac{e^u}{e^u+u} du + \int_0^1 \frac{1}{e^u+u} du$

8) The first integral is straightforward:

   $\int_0^1 \frac{e^u}{e^u+u} du = \ln(e^u+u)|_0^1 = \ln(e+1) - \ln(1) = \ln(e+1)$

9) The second integral is more complex, but it can be solved using the substitution $v = e^u + u$. Then $dv = (e^u + 1) du$.

10) When $u = 0$, $v = e^0 + 0 = 1$. When $u = 1$, $v = e^1 + 1 = e + 1$.

11) Substituting:

    $\int_0^1 \frac{1}{e^u+u} du = \int_1^{e+1} \frac{1}{v} dv = \ln v|_1^{e+1} = \ln(e+1) - \ln(1) = \ln(e+1)$

12) Adding the two integrals:

    $V = \ln(e+1) + \ln(e+1) = 2\ln(e+1)$

Therefore, the volume of the solid is $2\ln(e+1)$.

문제 27:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand what we're given. We have a cubic function $f(x)$ with leading coefficient 1, meaning it's of the form $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$.

2) We're then told that $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x$. This means that to get $g(x)$, we replace every $x$ in $f(x)$ with $e^x$, and then add $e^x$ to the result.

3) Next, we're told that the tangent to the curve $y=g(x)$ at the point $(0, g(0))$ is the $x$-axis. This means that the derivative of $g(x)$ at $x=0$ must be zero. In other words, $g'(0) = 0$.

4) Now, let's find $g'(x)$. Using the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$, we get:

   $g'(x) = f'(e^x) \cdot e^x + e^x$

5) Since $f(x)$ is a cubic with leading coefficient 1, its derivative $f'(x)$ is a quadratic of the form $3x^2 + 2ax + b$. So:

   $g'(x) = (3e^{2x} + 2ae^x + b) \cdot e^x + e^x$

6) Now, we use the fact that $g'(0) = 0$. This means:

   $0 = (3e^0 + 2a \cdot e^0 + b) \cdot e^0 + e^0$
   $0 = 3 + 2a + b + 1$
   $0 = 4 + 2a + b$
   $b = -4 - 2a$

7) We're also told that $g(x)$ has an inverse function $h(x)$. For inverse functions, the derivative of the inverse at a point is the reciprocal of the derivative of the original function at the corresponding point. In other words, $h'(g(x)) = \frac{1}{g'(x)}$.

8) We're asked to find $h'(8)$. To do this, we need to find the value of $x$ such that $g(x) = 8$, and then evaluate $\frac{1}{g'(x)}$ at that value of $x$.

9) Unfortunately, without knowing the specific values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can't solve the equation $g(x) = 8$. And without knowing $x$, we can't evaluate $\frac{1}{g'(x)}$.

Therefore, there is not enough information given in the problem to determine the value of $h'(8)$. The problem cannot be solved without additional information about the specific cubic function $f(x)$.

문제 28:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's find the equation of the tangent line at the point $(t, f(t))$. The general form is:

   $y - f(t) = f'(t)(x - t)$

2) At $x = t$, we have $f'(t) = -t + e^{1-t^2}$. So the equation of the tangent line is:

   $y - f(t) = (-t + e^{1-t^2})(x - t)$

3) Now, let's find the $x$-intercept of this tangent line. At the $x$-intercept, $y = 0$. So:

   $0 - f(t) = (-t + e^{1-t^2})(x - t)$
   
   $f(t) = (t - e^{1-t^2})(x - t)$
   
   $x = t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}}$

4) The area $g(t)$ is the area under the curve $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to this $x$-intercept, minus the area under the tangent line over the same interval. 

   $g(t) = \int_0^{t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}}} f(x) dx - \int_0^{t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}}} (-t + e^{1-t^2})(x - t) + f(t) dx$

5) To find $g'(t)$, we would need to differentiate this expression with respect to $t$. However, we don't know the explicit form of $f(x)$, only its derivative. So we can't evaluate this integral or its derivative directly.

6) However, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. It states that if $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then:

   $\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$

   And if $b$ is a function of $t$, then:

   $\frac{d}{dt} \int_a^{b(t)} f(x) dx = f(b(t)) \cdot b'(t)$

7) Applying this to our problem:

   $g'(t) = f(t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}}) \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}}) - [(-t + e^{1-t^2})(t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}} - t) + f(t)] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}})$

8) Simplifying:

   $g'(t) = [f(t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}}) - f(t)] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(t + \frac{f(t)}{t - e^{1-t^2}})$

9) Now, let's evaluate this at $t = 1$:

   $g'(1) = [f(1 + \frac{f(1)}{1 - e^{1-1^2}}) - f(1)] \cdot \frac{d}{dt}(1 + \frac{f(1)}{1 - e^{1-1^2}})|_{t=1}$

10) We don't know the values of $f(1)$ or $\frac{d}{dt}(1 + \frac{f(1)}{1 - e^{1-1^2}})|_{t=1}$, but we don't need to. The question asks for $g(1) + g'(

문제 29:
Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1) First, let's understand what the given equations mean. 
   - The first equation is the sum of the absolute values of the terms plus the terms themselves. 
   - The second equation is the sum of the absolute values of the terms minus the terms themselves.

2) If we add these two equations, we get:
   $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2|a_n| = \frac{60}{3} = 20 $$
   This means that the sum of the absolute values of the terms is 10.

3) If we subtract the second equation from the first, we get:
   $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2a_n = \frac{20}{3} $$
   This means that the sum of the terms is $\frac{10}{3}$.

4) Now, for a geometric sequence, the sum of the terms is given by:
   $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \frac{a_1}{1-r} $$
   where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.

5) From step 3, we know that this sum is $\frac{10}{3}$. So:
   $$ \frac{a_1}{1-r} = \frac{10}{3} $$

6) Now, let's look at the inequality. The term $(-1)^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}}$ alternates between 1 and -1. So, the inequality is essentially comparing the difference between the sum of odd-indexed terms and even-indexed terms with $\frac{1}{700}$.

7) For a geometric sequence, this difference is always equal to the first term. This is because the even-indexed terms cancel out the odd-indexed terms except for the first term.

8) So, for the inequality to hold, we need $a_1 > \frac{1}{700}$.

9) Now, let's solve for $a_1$ and $r$ using the equations from steps 2 and 5:
   $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| = \frac{|a_1|}{1-|r|} = 10 $$
   $$ \frac{a_1}{1-r} = \frac{10}{3} $$

10) From these equations, we can find that $a_1 = 2$ and $r = \frac{2}{5}$.

11) Since $a_1 = 2 > \frac{1}{700}$, the inequality holds for all natural numbers $m$.

12) Therefore, the sum of all such $m$ is the sum of all natural numbers, which is infinite.

So, the final answer is that the sum of all such $m$ is infinite.

문제 30:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) From condition (a), $f(0) = \sin(b) = 0$, so $b = 0$ or $b = \pi$. But if $b = \pi$, then $f(2\pi) = \sin(2\pi a + \pi + 0) = -\sin(2\pi a) \neq 2\pi a + b$. Therefore, $b = 0$.

2) Now, $f(x) = \sin(ax + \sin x)$. To find where $f(x)$ has local maxima, we need to find where $f'(x) = 0$.

   $f'(x) = a\cos(ax + \sin x) + \cos x \cos(ax + \sin x) = (a + \cos x)\cos(ax + \sin x)$

3) $f'(x) = 0$ when either $a + \cos x = 0$ or $\cos(ax + \sin x) = 0$.

4) From condition (b), $f'(0) = f'(4\pi)$. This means $a + \cos 0 = a + \cos 4\pi$, which is always true. So this doesn't give us any new information.

5) Let's solve $a + \cos x = 0$. This gives $\cos x = -a$. Since $1 \leq a \leq 2$, there is no solution for $x$ in the real numbers.

6) Now let's solve $\cos(ax + \sin x) = 0$. This means $ax + \sin x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi$ for integer $k$.

7) The smallest positive solution will be when $k = 0$, i.e., $ax + \sin x = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Let's call this value of $x$ as $\alpha_1$.

8) The next solution will be when $k = 1$, i.e., $ax + \sin x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$. Let's call this value of $x$ as $\alpha_2$.

9) Since we're only considering $x$ in the open interval $(0, 4\pi)$, and $1 \leq a \leq 2$, there will be no more solutions. Therefore, $n = 2$.

10) From the given condition, $n\alpha_1 = \frac{q}{p}\pi + ab = \frac{q}{p}\pi$ (since $b = 0$).

11) Therefore, $2\alpha_1 = \frac{q}{p}\pi$, or $\alpha_1 = \frac{q}{2p}\pi$.

12) Substituting this in the equation from step 7: $\frac{aq}{2p}\pi + \sin(\frac{q}{2p}\pi) = \frac{\pi}{2}$

13) Solving this equation for specific values of $a$, $p$, and $q$ would require numerical methods. However, we don't need to do that. The question asks for the value of $p + q$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime natural numbers.

14) The smallest possible values for $p$ and $q$ that satisfy this equation are $p = 1$ and $q = 1$. This can be verified by substituting these values and $a = 1$ (the smallest possible value for $a$) into the equation.

Therefore, the smallest possible value for $p + q$ is $1 + 1 = 2$, which is the answer.
