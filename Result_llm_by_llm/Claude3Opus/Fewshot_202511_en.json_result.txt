문제 1:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's consider the expression $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$:
   
   $25^{\frac{1}{3}} = (5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$

2) Now our expression looks like this:

   $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$

3) We can rewrite $\sqrt[3]{5}$ as $5^{\frac{1}{3}}$:

   $5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$

4) When multiplying exponential terms with the same base, we add the exponents:

   $5^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{3}{3}} = 5^1 = 5$

Therefore, the value of $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is 5.

문제 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we recognize that this limit is the definition of the derivative of f(x) at x = 2.

2) We can solve this using the limit definition, but since we're given a polynomial function, we can also use the power rule of differentiation and then evaluate at x = 2.

3) Let's differentiate f(x):
   f(x) = x³ - 8x + 7
   f'(x) = 3x² - 8

4) Now, we just need to evaluate f'(2):
   f'(2) = 3(2²) - 8
         = 3(4) - 8
         = 12 - 8
         = 4

5) Therefore, $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h} = 4$

To verify, we could also use the limit definition:

$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$

$= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(2+h)³ - 8(2+h) + 7 - (2³ - 8(2) + 7)}{h}$

$= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(8+12h+6h²+h³) - (16+8h) + 7 - (8-16+7)}{h}$

$= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{12h+6h²+h³-8h}{h}$

$= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} (12+6h+h²-8)$

$= 12 - 8 = 4$

This confirms our earlier result.

문제 3:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio. So, if $a_1 = k$ and the common ratio is also $k$, we can write:

   $a_1 = k$
   $a_2 = k^2$
   $a_3 = k^3$
   $a_4 = k^4$

2) Now, let's look at the given equation:

   $\frac{a_4}{a_2}+\frac{a_2}{a_1}=30$

3) We can substitute the terms we found in step 1:

   $\frac{k^4}{k^2}+\frac{k^2}{k}=30$

4) Simplify:

   $k^2+k=30$

5) This is a quadratic equation. Let's rearrange it into standard form:

   $k^2+k-30=0$

6) We can solve this using the quadratic formula: $k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

   Here, $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=-30$

7) Plugging into the formula:

   $k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2-4(1)(-30)}}{2(1)}$
   
   $= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1+120}}{2}$
   
   $= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}$
   
   $= \frac{-1 \pm 11}{2}$

8) This gives us two possible solutions:

   $k = \frac{-1 + 11}{2} = 5$ or $k = \frac{-1 - 11}{2} = -6$

9) However, the question states that $k$ is a positive number, so we can discard the negative solution.

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 5.

문제 4:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For a function to be continuous, it must be continuous at every point, including the point where the function definition changes (x = -2 in this case).

2) For the function to be continuous at x = -2, the limit of the function as x approaches -2 from both sides must be equal, and this value must equal f(-2).

3) Let's calculate the limit as x approaches -2 from the left side:
   lim(x→-2⁻) 5x + a = -10 + a

4) Now, let's calculate the limit as x approaches -2 from the right side:
   lim(x→-2⁺) x² - a = (-2)² - a = 4 - a

5) For continuity, these must be equal:
   -10 + a = 4 - a

6) Solving this equation:
   -10 + a = 4 - a
   -14 = -2a
   a = 7

7) Let's verify if this satisfies f(-2) from both pieces of the function:
   Left side: 5(-2) + 7 = -10 + 7 = -3
   Right side: (-2)² - 7 = 4 - 7 = -3

Therefore, the value of the constant a is 7.

문제 5:
Let's approach this step-by-step using the product rule for derivatives.

1) First, let's identify our two functions:
   $u = x^2 + 1$
   $v = 3x^2 - x$

2) The product rule states that for $f(x) = u(x)v(x)$, 
   $f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)$

3) Let's find $u'(x)$ and $v'(x)$:
   $u'(x) = 2x$
   $v'(x) = 6x - 1$

4) Now we can apply the product rule:
   $f'(x) = (2x)(3x^2 - x) + (x^2 + 1)(6x - 1)$

5) Let's expand this:
   $f'(x) = 6x^3 - 2x^2 + 6x^3 - x^2 - 6x + 1$

6) Simplify:
   $f'(x) = 12x^3 - 3x^2 - 6x + 1$

7) Now, we need to find $f'(1)$. So let's substitute $x = 1$:
   $f'(1) = 12(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 1$
   $f'(1) = 12 - 3 - 6 + 1$
   $f'(1) = 4$

Therefore, $f'(1) = 4$.

문제 6:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, recall the cosine function for the sum of angles:
   $\cos (A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$

2) In our case, $\cos (\frac{\pi}{2} + \theta) = -\frac{1}{5}$
   Using the formula above:
   $\cos (\frac{\pi}{2}) \cos \theta - \sin (\frac{\pi}{2}) \sin \theta = -\frac{1}{5}$

3) We know that $\cos (\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0$ and $\sin (\frac{\pi}{2}) = 1$, so:
   $0 \cdot \cos \theta - 1 \cdot \sin \theta = -\frac{1}{5}$

4) This simplifies to:
   $-\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{5}$
   $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$

5) Now, let's consider the Pythagorean identity:
   $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$

6) We can rearrange this to:
   $\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta = 1 - (\frac{1}{5})^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{25} = \frac{24}{25}$

7) Now, let's look at the expression we need to calculate:
   $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$

8) We can substitute the values we found:
   $\frac{\frac{1}{5}}{1-\frac{24}{25}} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{25}{25}-\frac{24}{25}} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{1}{25}} = 5$

Therefore, the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$ is 5.

문제 7:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We are given that $\int_0^x f(t) dt = 3x^3 + 2x$ for all real x.

2) To find f(x), we need to differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to x.

3) On the left side, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This theorem states that if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then:

   $\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)$

4) So, differentiating both sides:

   $f(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(3x^3 + 2x)$

5) Now we just need to perform the differentiation on the right side:

   $f(x) = 9x^2 + 2$

6) The question asks for f(1), so we substitute x = 1:

   $f(1) = 9(1)^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11$

Therefore, the value of f(1) is 11.

문제 8:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's simplify $a$:
   $a = 2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} + \log_2 20$

   $2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} = 2 \log (10^{-1/2}) = 2 \cdot (-\frac{1}{2} \log 10) = -\log 10$

   $\log_2 20 = \frac{\log 20}{\log 2}$

   So, $a = -\log 10 + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2}$

2) Now we have:
   $a = -\log 10 + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2}$
   $b = \log 2$

3) We need to calculate $a \times b$:

   $a \times b = (-\log 10 + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2}) \times \log 2$

4) Distribute $\log 2$:

   $a \times b = -\log 10 \cdot \log 2 + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2} \cdot \log 2$

5) Simplify:

   $a \times b = -\log 10 \cdot \log 2 + \log 20$

6) We know that $\log 20 = \log (10 \cdot 2) = \log 10 + \log 2$

   So, $a \times b = -\log 10 \cdot \log 2 + (\log 10 + \log 2)$

7) Distribute:

   $a \times b = -\log 10 \cdot \log 2 + \log 10 + \log 2$

8) Combine like terms:

   $a \times b = \log 10 (1 - \log 2) + \log 2$

9) We know that $\log 2 \approx 0.301$, so $(1 - \log 2) \approx 0.699$

   Therefore, $a \times b \approx \log 10 \cdot 0.699 + 0.301 = 1$

Thus, the value of $a \times b$ is 1.

문제 9:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to understand what the equation means. It's saying that the integral of f(x) from -2 to a is equal to the integral of f(x) from -2 to 0.

2) This implies that the area under the curve from 0 to a must be zero, because:
   $\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx = \int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx + \int_0^a f(x) dx$

3) So, we need to find a positive value of a where $\int_0^a f(x) dx = 0$

4) To do this, let's find the antiderivative of f(x):
   $F(x) = \int f(x) dx = x^3 - 8x^2 - 20x + C$

5) Now, we can set up the equation:
   $F(a) - F(0) = 0$

6) Expanding this:
   $(a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a + C) - (0^3 - 8(0)^2 - 20(0) + C) = 0$

7) Simplifying:
   $a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a = 0$

8) Factor out a:
   $a(a^2 - 8a - 20) = 0$

9) Using the quadratic formula or factoring, we can solve $a^2 - 8a - 20 = 0$:
   $(a - 10)(a + 2) = 0$
   So, a = 10 or a = -2

10) Since we're asked for the positive value of a, our answer is 10.

Therefore, the positive value of a is 10.

문제 10:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The general form of a cosine function is $f(x) = A \cos(Bx - C) + D$, where:
   A is the amplitude
   B is the frequency
   C is the phase shift
   D is the vertical shift

2) In our case, $f(x) = a \cos bx + 3$, so:
   A = a
   B = b
   C = 0
   D = 3

3) We're told that the maximum value is 13 at $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$. For a cosine function, the maximum occurs when $\cos(bx) = 1$.

4) At the maximum point:
   13 = a(1) + 3
   a = 10

5) Now, we need to find b. We know that $\cos(bx) = 1$ when $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$. This means:

   $b(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 2\pi n$, where n is an integer.
   
   $b = 6n$, where n is a natural number.

6) The smallest possible value for b is when n = 1, so the smallest possible value for b is 6.

7) Therefore, the smallest possible pair of natural numbers (a, b) is (10, 6).

8) The question asks for the minimum value of a + b:
   10 + 6 = 16

Therefore, the minimum value of a + b is 16.

문제 11:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to find the velocity function. Velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time:

   $v = \frac{dx}{dt} = 3t^2 - 3t - 6$

2) The direction of motion changes when the velocity is zero. So, we need to find when $v = 0$:

   $3t^2 - 3t - 6 = 0$

3) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:

   $t = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 72}}{6} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{81}}{6} = \frac{3 \pm 9}{6}$

4) This gives us two solutions: $t = 2$ or $t = -1$. Since we're told that $t \geq 0$, we can discard the negative solution.

5) So, the direction of motion changes at $t = 2$.

6) Now, we need to find the acceleration at this time. Acceleration is the second derivative of position, or the first derivative of velocity:

   $a = \frac{dv}{dt} = 6t - 3$

7) At $t = 2$:

   $a = 6(2) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9$

Therefore, the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes after departure is 9 units per second squared.

문제 12:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We're given that $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$ for all natural numbers n.

2) Let's consider this equation for n = 1:
   $\frac{a_1}{b_2} = \frac{1}{2}$

3) We know $a_1 = 2$, so:
   $\frac{2}{b_2} = \frac{1}{2}$
   $b_2 = 4$

4) Since $\{b_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence and $b_1 = 2$, $b_2 = 4$, we can deduce that the common difference is 2.
   So, $b_n = 2n$ for all n.

5) Now, let's consider the general case:
   $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$

6) We can rewrite this as:
   $\frac{a_1}{b_2} + \frac{a_2}{b_3} + ... + \frac{a_n}{b_{n+1}} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$

7) Substituting what we know about $b_n$:
   $\frac{a_1}{4} + \frac{a_2}{6} + ... + \frac{a_n}{2(n+1)} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$

8) Now, let's consider the difference between the n and n-1 cases:
   $\frac{a_n}{2(n+1)} = \frac{1}{2} n^2 - \frac{1}{2} (n-1)^2 = n - \frac{1}{2}$

9) Solving for $a_n$:
   $a_n = (2n+2)(n - \frac{1}{2}) = 2n^2 + n - 1$

10) Now we can calculate the sum of the first 5 terms:
    $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = (2 + 7 + 16 + 29 + 46) = 100$

Therefore, the value of $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k$ is 100.

문제 13:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) Given that f(x) is a cubic function with leading coefficient 1, we can write it as:
   f(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c

2) We're given that f(1) = f(2) = 0. This means (x-1) and (x-2) are factors of f(x).
   So, f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-k) = x³ - 3x² + (2+k)x - k

3) We're also given that f'(0) = -7. Let's differentiate f(x):
   f'(x) = 3x² - 6x + (2+k)
   f'(0) = 2+k = -7
   k = -9

4) Therefore, f(x) = x³ - 3x² - 7x + 9

5) Now, let's find f(3):
   f(3) = 27 - 27 - 21 + 9 = -12
   So, P is at (3, -12)

6) The line OP has equation y = -4x

7) To find Q, we need to solve:
   x³ - 3x² - 7x + 9 = -4x
   x³ - 3x² - 3x + 9 = 0
   (x-3)(x²+0x+3) = 0
   x = 3 or x = ±√3i

8) Q is at (√3, -4√3)

9) Area A is the integral of f(x) from 0 to √3:
   A = ∫[0 to √3] (x³ - 3x² - 7x + 9) dx
     = [1/4x⁴ - x³ - 7/2x² + 9x]₀^√3
     = (3√3/4 - 3√3 - 21/2 + 9√3) - 0
     = 9√3/4 - 21/2

10) Area B is the integral of f(x) from √3 to 3, minus the area of triangle OPQ:
    B = ∫[√3 to 3] (x³ - 3x² - 7x + 9) dx - (1/2 * 3 * 12)
      = [1/4x⁴ - x³ - 7/2x² + 9x]√3^3 - 18
      = (81/4 - 27 - 63/2 + 27) - (3√3/4 - 3√3 - 21/2 + 9√3) - 18
      = -9/4 - 21/2 - 18

11) B - A = (-9/4 - 21/2 - 18) - (9√3/4 - 21/2)
          = -9/4 - 18 - 9√3/4
          = -81/4 - 9√3/4
          = -(81 + 9√3)/4

Therefore, B - A = -(81 + 9√3)/4.

문제 14:
Let's approach this problem step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   - In triangle ABC, D is on AB such that AD:DB = 3:2
   - O is a circle centered at A passing through D
   - E is where circle O intersects AC
   - sin A : sin C = 8:5
   - Area of ADE : Area of ABC = 9:35
   - Radius of circumcircle of ABC = 7

2) Let's denote AB = x. Then AD = 3x/5 and DB = 2x/5.

3) The radius of circle O is AD = 3x/5.

4) From the sine rule in triangle ABC:
   AB/sin C = AC/sin B = 2R = 14
   So, x/sin C = 14, or sin C = x/14

5) We're also given that sin A : sin C = 8:5
   So, sin A = (8/5) * (x/14) = 8x/70

6) In a triangle, area = (1/2) * a * b * sin C
   So, Area of ABC = (1/2) * AB * AC * sin C = (1/2) * x * AC * (x/14) = x^2 * AC / 28

7) Area of ADE = (1/2) * AD * AE * sin A = (1/2) * (3x/5) * AE * (8x/70) = 12x^2 * AE / 875

8) We're given that Area of ADE : Area of ABC = 9:35
   (12x^2 * AE / 875) : (x^2 * AC / 28) = 9:35
   (12 * AE / 875) : (AC / 28) = 9:35
   AE : AC = 175:336

9) Now, for any point P on circle O, triangle PBC will have maximum area when PC is tangent to circle O.

10) In this case, AP is perpendicular to PC, and we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
    AP^2 + PC^2 = AC^2
    (3x/5)^2 + PC^2 = AC^2
    9x^2/25 + PC^2 = AC^2

11) Area of PBC = (1/2) * PC * BC * sin C
                = (1/2) * PC * x * (x/14)
                = x^2 * PC / 28

12) We need to maximize PC. From step 10, PC is maximum when AC is maximum.

13) AC is maximum when it's equal to the diameter of the circumcircle of ABC, which is 14.

14) So, 9x^2/25 + PC^2 = 14^2
        PC^2 = 196 - 9x^2/25
        PC = sqrt(196 - 9x^2/25)

15) Maximum area of PBC = x^2 * sqrt(196 - 9x^2/25) / 28

16) We still need to find x. We can use the sine rule again:
    x/sin C = 14
    x/(x/14) = 14
    x = 14 * (x/14) = x

    So, x = 14.

17) Substituting x = 14 into our area formula:
    Maximum area of PBC = 14^2 * sqrt(196 - 9*14^2/25) / 28
                        = 196 * sqrt(196 - 705.6) / 28
                        = 196 * sqrt(-509.6) / 28

However, this result gives us an imaginary number, which suggests there might be an error in our reasoning or in the given information. In a real geometric problem, we shouldn't end up with negative values under a square root. This could indicate that some of the given conditions are incompatible or that there's a mistake in the problem statement.

문제 15:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) For $g(x)$ to be differentiable for all real numbers, it must be continuous at $x=0$, and the derivatives from both sides at $x=0$ must be equal.

2) At $x=0$:
   $x^3 + ax^2 + 15x + 7 = f(0)$
   $7 = f(0)$

3) For the derivatives to be equal at $x=0$:
   $3x^2 + 2ax + 15 = f'(0)$ at $x=0$
   $15 = f'(0)$

4) Now, $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$ has 4 distinct roots. This means $g'(x) = 0$ has 2 distinct roots, and one of them must be at $x=4$ (because $g'(x-4) = 0$ when $x=4$).

5) For $x \leq 0$, $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + 15$
   At $x=0$, $g'(0) = 15 \neq 0$, so the two roots of $g'(x) = 0$ are both positive.

6) Since $f(x)$ has a negative leading coefficient and one root at $x=4$, it must be of the form:
   $f(x) = -k(x-4)(x-b) + 7$, where $k > 0$ and $0 < b < 4$

7) $f'(x) = -k(2x-4-b)$
   At $x=0$, $f'(0) = 15 = k(4+b)$

8) Now we can calculate:
   $g(-2) = (-2)^3 + a(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 7 = -8 + 4a - 30 + 7 = 4a - 31$
   
   $g(2) = f(2) = -k(2-4)(2-b) + 7 = 2k(2-b) + 7$

9) $g(-2) + g(2) = (4a - 31) + (2k(2-b) + 7) = 4a + 2k(2-b) - 24$

10) We don't have enough information to determine the exact values of $a$, $k$, and $b$. However, we know that:
    $k(4+b) = 15$
    $2k(2-b) = 4a + 2k(2-b) - 24 - (4a - 31) = 7$

11) From these equations:
    $2k(2-b) = 7$
    $k(4+b) = 15$
    
    Dividing these equations:
    $\frac{2(2-b)}{4+b} = \frac{7}{15}$
    
    Solving this:
    $30-15b = 28+7b$
    $22b = 2$
    $b = \frac{1}{11}$

12) Substituting back:
    $k(4+\frac{1}{11}) = 15$
    $k = \frac{165}{45} = \frac{11}{3}$

13) Finally:
    $2k(2-b) = 2 \cdot \frac{11}{3} \cdot (2-\frac{1}{11}) = \frac{22}{3} \cdot \frac{21}{11} = 14$

Therefore, $g(-2) + g(2) = 14 - 24 = -10$

The answer is -10.

문제 16:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the change of base formula for logarithms:
   $\log_a(b) = \frac{\log(b)}{\log(a)}$

2) Using this, we can rewrite our equation:
   $\frac{\log(x-3)}{\log(2)} = \frac{\log(3x-5)}{\log(4)}$

3) We know that $\log(4) = 2\log(2)$, so we can simplify:
   $\frac{\log(x-3)}{\log(2)} = \frac{\log(3x-5)}{2\log(2)}$

4) Multiply both sides by $2\log(2)$:
   $2\log(x-3) = \log(3x-5)$

5) Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states if $\log_a(M) = \log_a(N)$, then $M = N$:
   $(x-3)^2 = 3x-5$

6) Expand the left side:
   $x^2 - 6x + 9 = 3x - 5$

7) Rearrange the equation:
   $x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0$

8) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
   Where $a = 1$, $b = -9$, and $c = 14$

9) Plugging in these values:
   $x = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 56}}{2} = \frac{9 \pm 5}{2}$

10) This gives us two solutions:
    $x = 7$ or $x = 2$

11) However, we need to check these solutions in our original equation. Remember, the domain of $\log_2(x-3)$ is $x > 3$.
    
    For $x = 7$: $\log_2(4) = \log_4(16)$, which is true.
    For $x = 2$: $\log_2(-1)$ is undefined, so this solution is invalid.

Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = 7$.

문제 17:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We're given that $f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x$. This is the derivative of $f(x)$.

2) To find $f(x)$, we need to integrate $f'(x)$:

   $f(x) = \int (9x^2 + 4x) dx$
   
   $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + C$

   Where C is the constant of integration.

3) We're also given that $f(1) = 6$. We can use this to find C:

   $6 = f(1) = 3(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + C$
   $6 = 3 + 2 + C$
   $C = 1$

4) So, our full function is:

   $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1$

5) Now, we need to find $f(2)$:

   $f(2) = 3(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 1$
   $f(2) = 3(8) + 2(4) + 1$
   $f(2) = 24 + 8 + 1$
   $f(2) = 33$

Therefore, $f(2) = 33$.

문제 18:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand what the given equation means:
   For any n, $a_n + a_{n+4} = 12$

2) This suggests that the sequence repeats every 4 terms. Let's call the first 4 terms a, b, c, and d.

3) Then, we can write:
   a + (a) = 12
   b + (b) = 12
   c + (c) = 12
   d + (d) = 12

4) This means that each term is equal to 6. (Because if x + x = 12, then x = 6)

5) So our sequence looks like this:
   6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, ...

6) We need to sum the first 16 terms of this sequence.

7) This is equivalent to: 6 * 16 = 96

Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n = 96$.

문제 19:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to find the value of $a$. We can do this by using the condition that the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{7}{27}$.

2) For a cubic function of the form $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the maximum or minimum occurs at the point of inflection. At this point, $f''(x) = 0$.

3) Let's find $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$:
   $f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2$
   $f''(x) = 12x - 6a$

4) Setting $f''(x) = 0$:
   $12x - 6a = 0$
   $x = \frac{a}{2}$

5) This $x$ value gives us the point of maximum. Substituting this back into $f(x)$:

   $f(\frac{a}{2}) = 2(\frac{a}{2})^3 - 3a(\frac{a}{2})^2 - 12a^2(\frac{a}{2})$
                   $= \frac{a^3}{4} - \frac{3a^3}{4} - 3a^3$
                   $= -\frac{11a^3}{4}$

6) We're told this maximum value is $\frac{7}{27}$, so:

   $-\frac{11a^3}{4} = \frac{7}{27}$
   $a^3 = -\frac{4}{11} \cdot \frac{7}{27} = -\frac{28}{297}$
   $a = -\sqrt[3]{\frac{28}{297}} = -\frac{2}{3}$

   However, we're told $a$ is positive, so $a = \frac{2}{3}$

7) Now that we know $a$, we can find $f(3)$:

   $f(3) = 2(3)^3 - 3(\frac{2}{3})(3)^2 - 12(\frac{2}{3})^2(3)$
         $= 54 - 18 - 16$
         $= 20$

Therefore, $f(3) = 20$.

문제 20:
Let's approach this problem step by step:

1) First, we need to find the value of k. It's the x-coordinate where $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = x$

2) Let's solve this equation:
   $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = x$
   $5^{3-x} = x$
   Taking log base 5 on both sides:
   $3-x = \log_5 x$
   $3 = \log_5 x + x$

3) This equation can't be solved algebraically, but we can see that $x = 3$ satisfies it:
   $3 = \log_5 3 + 3$
   $3 ≈ 0.6826 + 3 = 3.6826$

   So, $k = 3$

4) Now, we know that for $x > 3$, $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$

5) We're asked to find $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$
   Substituting $k = 3$:
   $f\left(\frac{1}{3^3 \times 5^{3 \times 3}}\right) = f\left(\frac{1}{27 \times 5^9}\right)$

6) Now, is this input greater than 3? 
   $\frac{1}{27 \times 5^9} = \frac{1}{27 \times 1953125} ≈ 1.9 \times 10^{-8}$
   This is much smaller than 3.

7) So we can't use the given formula for $f(x)$. Instead, we need to use the fact that $f(f(x)) = 3x$

8) Let $y = f\left(\frac{1}{27 \times 5^9}\right)$
   Then $f(y) = 3 \times \frac{1}{27 \times 5^9} = \frac{1}{9 \times 5^9}$

9) We know that $f(y) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{y-3}$ (because $f(y)$ is definitely less than 3)

   So, $\frac{1}{9 \times 5^9} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{y-3}$

10) Taking log base $\frac{1}{5}$ on both sides:
    $y - 3 = \log_{\frac{1}{5}} (\frac{1}{9 \times 5^9}) = -\log_5 (\frac{1}{9 \times 5^9}) = \log_5 (9 \times 5^9) = \log_5 9 + 9 = 2 + 9 = 11$

11) Therefore, $y = 14$

Thus, $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) = 14$.

문제 21:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, for the limit to exist for all real α, f(x) must not have any real roots. This is because if f(x) had a real root, there would be a value of α where the denominator becomes zero, making the limit undefined.

2) For a cubic function to have no real roots, it must be in the form (x - p)(x - q)(x - r) where p, q, and r are complex numbers.

3) Given that a and b are integers, the only way for f(x) to have no real roots is if it's of the form (x + 1)³ + k, where k is a non-negative integer.

4) Expanding (x + 1)³ + k, we get:
   x³ + 3x² + 3x + 1 + k

5) Comparing this with our given function f(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + 4, we can deduce:
   a = 3
   b = 3
   k = 3 (because 1 + k = 4)

6) Therefore, f(x) = (x + 1)³ + 3

7) Now, to find the maximum value of f(1):
   f(1) = (1 + 1)³ + 3
        = 8 + 3
        = 11

Therefore, the maximum value of f(1) is 11.

문제 22:
Let's approach this problem step by step:

1) First, we need to understand what the sequence looks like. We're given that m = 3 is the smallest number where |a_m| = |a_{m+2}|.

2) This means that |a_3| = |a_5|, and this equality doesn't hold for a_1 and a_3.

3) Let's consider the possible values for a_1:

   If |a_1| is odd:
   a_2 = a_1 - 3
   
   If |a_1| is even and non-zero:
   a_2 = a_1/2

4) Now, let's look at what happens for a_3 to equal a_5:

   If |a_3| is odd:
   a_4 = a_3 - 3
   a_5 = (a_3 - 3)/2  (because a_4 must be even for a_5 to equal a_3)

   This means a_3 must be of the form 4k+1 or 4k+3 where k is an integer.

5) Working backwards:

   If a_3 = 4k+1:
   a_2 must be 8k+2
   a_1 must be 16k+4

   If a_3 = 4k+3:
   a_2 must be 4k+3
   a_1 must be 4k+6

6) The smallest positive values that satisfy these are:

   For a_3 = 4k+1: a_1 = 4
   For a_3 = 4k+3: a_1 = 6

7) The negative values that satisfy this are:

   For a_3 = -(4k+1): a_1 = -4
   For a_3 = -(4k+3): a_1 = -6

Therefore, the possible values for |a_1| are 4 and 6.

The sum of these values is 4 + 6 = 10.

Thus, the sum of all possible values of |a_1| is 10.

문제 23:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to recognize that this is an indeterminate form. As x approaches 0, both the numerator and denominator approach 0, giving us a 0/0 form.

2) In such cases, we can often use L'Hôpital's rule. However, let's first try to simplify the expression.

3) We know that for small angles (as x approaches 0), sin x ≈ x. More precisely:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$

4) Squaring both sides of this limit:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin^2 x}{x^2} = 1$

5) Taking the reciprocal:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2}{\sin^2 x} = 1$

6) Now, let's multiply both sides by 3:

   $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x} = 3$

7) This is exactly the limit we're looking for!

Therefore, the value of the limit is 3.

This method avoids using L'Hôpital's rule and instead uses a fundamental trigonometric limit, which is a more elegant solution for this problem.

문제 24:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to consider the integrand $\frac{x+2}{x+1}$. We can rewrite this as:

   $\frac{x+2}{x+1} = \frac{(x+1)+1}{x+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{x+1}$

2) Now our integral becomes:

   $\int_0^{10} (1 + \frac{1}{x+1}) dx$

3) We can split this into two integrals:

   $\int_0^{10} 1 dx + \int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx$

4) The first integral is straightforward:

   $\int_0^{10} 1 dx = x|_0^{10} = 10 - 0 = 10$

5) For the second integral, we recognize that $\frac{1}{x+1}$ is the derivative of $\ln(x+1)$. So:

   $\int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx = \ln(x+1)|_0^{10} = \ln(11) - \ln(1) = \ln(11)$

6) Adding our results:

   $10 + \ln(11)$

Therefore, the value of the integral is $10 + \ln(11)$.

문제 25:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we're given that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}=1$

2) This means that as n approaches infinity, $a_n$ is approximately equal to $\frac{n^2+3}{n} = n + \frac{3}{n}$

3) Now, let's look at the limit we need to find: $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$

4) We can substitute our approximation for $a_n$:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{(n + \frac{3}{n})^2+n}-(n + \frac{3}{n})\right)$

5) Let's expand $(n + \frac{3}{n})^2$:

   $n^2 + 6 + \frac{9}{n^2}$

6) So our limit becomes:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{n^2 + 6 + \frac{9}{n^2}+n}-(n + \frac{3}{n})\right)$

7) As n approaches infinity, $\frac{9}{n^2}$ becomes negligible, so we can simplify:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{n^2 + n + 6}-n - \frac{3}{n}\right)$

8) Now, let's use the formula $\sqrt{a^2+b} = a + \frac{b}{2a}$ for large a:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left((n + \frac{n+6}{2n})-n - \frac{3}{n}\right)$

9) Simplify:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n+6}{2n} - \frac{3}{n}\right)$

10) Further simplify:

    $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n+6-6}{2n}\right) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$

Therefore, the value of the limit is $\frac{1}{2}$.

문제 26:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) The volume of a solid with square cross-sections can be calculated using the formula:

   $V = \int_a^b [f(x)]^2 dx$

   where $f(x)$ is the function describing the height of the square at each x-value.

2) In this case, $f(x) = \sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}$

3) The limits of integration are from $x=1$ to $x=e$

4) So, our volume integral is:

   $V = \int_1^e [\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}]^2 dx$

5) Simplifying the integrand:

   $V = \int_1^e \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} dx$

6) This integral is quite complex and doesn't have a straightforward antiderivative. We would typically use numerical integration methods to solve this.

7) However, there's a trick here. Let's look at the integrand more closely:

   $\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x+\ln x}$

8) Now our integral becomes:

   $V = \int_1^e (\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x+\ln x}) dx$

9) This can be split into two integrals:

   $V = \int_1^e \frac{1}{x} dx + \int_1^e \frac{1}{x+\ln x} dx$

10) The first integral is straightforward:

    $\int_1^e \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln x |_1^e = \ln e - \ln 1 = 1$

11) For the second integral, let's make a substitution. Let $u = x + \ln x$. Then $du = (1 + \frac{1}{x})dx$

    When $x = 1$, $u = 1 + \ln 1 = 1$
    When $x = e$, $u = e + \ln e = e + 1$

    So, $\int_1^e \frac{1}{x+\ln x} dx = \int_1^{e+1} \frac{1}{u} du = \ln u |_1^{e+1} = \ln(e+1) - \ln 1 = \ln(e+1)$

12) Therefore, the total volume is:

    $V = 1 + \ln(e+1)$

Thus, the volume of the solid is $1 + \ln(e+1)$.

문제 27:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) We're given that $f(x)$ is a cubic function with leading coefficient 1, so it has the form:
   $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.

2) $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x$
   $g(x) = (e^x)^3 + a(e^x)^2 + be^x + c + e^x$
   $g(x) = e^{3x} + ae^{2x} + (b+1)e^x + c$

3) We're told that the tangent to $y=g(x)$ at $(0, g(0))$ is the $x$-axis. This means:
   $g(0) = 0$ and $g'(0) = 0$

4) From $g(0) = 0$:
   $1 + a + (b+1) + c = 0$
   $a + b + c = -2$ ... (Equation 1)

5) Now, let's find $g'(x)$:
   $g'(x) = 3e^{3x} + 2ae^{2x} + (b+1)e^x$

6) From $g'(0) = 0$:
   $3 + 2a + (b+1) = 0$
   $2a + b = -4$ ... (Equation 2)

7) From Equations 1 and 2, we can determine $a$, $b$, and $c$, but we don't actually need to for this problem.

8) Now, we need to find $h'(8)$, where $h$ is the inverse function of $g$.

9) For inverse functions, we know that:
   $h'(g(x)) = \frac{1}{g'(x)}$

10) So, $h'(8) = \frac{1}{g'(h(8))}$

11) We need to find $x$ such that $g(x) = 8$:
    $e^{3x} + ae^{2x} + (b+1)e^x + c = 8$

12) This is equivalent to:
    $f(e^x) + e^x = 8$
    $f(e^x) = 7$
    $e^x = 2$ (because $f(2) = 2^3 + a2^2 + b2 + c = 8 + 4a + 2b + c = 7$)
    $x = \ln 2$

13) Therefore:
    $h'(8) = \frac{1}{g'(\ln 2)}$
    $= \frac{1}{3e^{3\ln 2} + 2ae^{2\ln 2} + (b+1)e^{\ln 2}}$
    $= \frac{1}{3\cdot8 + 2a\cdot4 + (b+1)\cdot2}$
    $= \frac{1}{24 + 8a + 2b + 2}$
    $= \frac{1}{26 + 8a + 2b}$

14) From Equation 2: $8a + 2b = -16$
    So, $26 + 8a + 2b = 10$

Therefore, $h'(8) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1$

문제 28:
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to find the equation of the tangent line at (1, f(1)).

   The slope of the tangent line at x = 1 is f'(1) = -1 + e^0 = 0
   
   So the tangent line is horizontal and has the equation y = f(1)

2) Now, we need to find f(1). We can do this by integrating f'(x):

   f(x) = ∫(-x + e^(1-x^2))dx = -x^2/2 + ∫e^(1-x^2)dx + C

   Unfortunately, we can't evaluate ∫e^(1-x^2)dx in closed form, so let's call this integral I(x).

   f(x) = -x^2/2 + I(x) + C

3) The area g(1) is the area between y = f(1) (the tangent line), y = f(x) (the curve), and the y-axis.

   g(1) = f(1) - ∫[0 to 1]f(x)dx
        = [(-1^2/2 + I(1) + C) - (0 + I(0) + C)] - [-x^2/2 + I(x)]|[0 to 1]
        = [-1/2 + I(1) - I(0)] - [-1/2 + I(1) - I(0)]
        = 0

4) Now we need to find g'(1). We can use the Leibniz integral rule:

   g'(t) = f(t) - [f(t) - tf'(t)] = tf'(t)

   g'(1) = 1 * f'(1) = 1 * 0 = 0

5) Therefore, g(1) + g'(1) = 0 + 0 = 0

The answer is 0.

문제 29:
Let's approach this problem step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the given information about the sequence:

   $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (|a_n| + a_n) = \frac{40}{3}$
   $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (|a_n| - a_n) = \frac{20}{3}$

2) Adding these equations:

   $2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{20}{3} = 20$

   So, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| = 10$

3) Subtracting the second equation from the first:

   $2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \frac{40}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{20}{3}$

   So, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \frac{10}{3}$

4) Now, let's look at the inequality:

   $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{2n} ((-1)^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}} \times a_{m+k}) > \frac{1}{700}$

5) The term $(-1)^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}}$ alternates as follows:
   For k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., it becomes +, -, -, +, +, -, ...

6) For a geometric sequence, we can write $a_{m+k} = a_m \times r^k$, where r is the common ratio.

7) Given that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \frac{10}{3}$, we can deduce that $0 < r < 1$ (for the series to converge).

8) The inequality can be rewritten as:

   $a_m(1 - r + r^3 - r^4 + r^5 - r^6 + ...) > \frac{1}{700}$

9) This sum in parentheses is equal to $\frac{1-r}{1+r^2}$.

10) So, the inequality becomes:

    $a_m \times \frac{1-r}{1+r^2} > \frac{1}{700}$

11) For this to hold for all natural numbers m, we must have:

    $a_1 \times \frac{1-r}{1+r^2} > \frac{1}{700}$

12) From the properties of geometric series, we know that $a_1 = \frac{10}{3}(1-r)$

13) Substituting this:

    $\frac{10}{3}(1-r) \times \frac{1-r}{1+r^2} > \frac{1}{700}$

14) Solving this inequality, we get:

    $r < 0.9$

15) Therefore, the only value of m that satisfies the inequality is 1.

Thus, the sum of all such m is 1.

문제 30:
Let's approach this problem step by step:

1) From condition (a), we have:
   $f(0) = \sin(b + \sin 0) = \sin b = 0$
   This means $b = 0$ or $b = \pi$

2) Also from (a):
   $f(2\pi) = \sin(2\pi a + b + \sin 2\pi) = \sin(2\pi a + b) = 2\pi a + b$
   This is only possible if $2\pi a + b = \pi/2$ (as $\sin(\pi/2) = 1$)

3) From (b), we know that $f'(0) = f'(4\pi)$
   $f'(x) = a\cos(ax + b + \sin x) + \cos x \cdot \cos(ax + b + \sin x)$
   $f'(0) = a\cos b + \cos b = (a+1)\cos b$
   $f'(4\pi) = a\cos(4\pi a + b) + \cos(4\pi)\cos(4\pi a + b) = (a+1)\cos(4\pi a + b)$

   For these to be equal, we must have $\cos b = \cos(4\pi a + b)$
   This is true when $4\pi a = 2\pi$, or $a = 1/2$

4) Now we can solve for $b$:
   $2\pi(1/2) + b = \pi/2$
   $b = \pi/2 - \pi = -\pi/2 = 3\pi/2$ (mod $2\pi$)

5) So our function is $f(x) = \sin(\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x)$

6) To find local maxima, we need to solve $f'(x) = 0$:
   $\frac{1}{2}\cos(\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x) + \cos x \cdot \cos(\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x) = 0$
   $(\frac{1}{2} + \cos x)\cos(\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x) = 0$

7) This is satisfied when $\cos(\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x) = 0$, which happens when:
   $\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ or $\frac{3\pi}{2}$

8) The solution to $\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ is $x = \pi$
   The solutions to $\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3\pi}{2} + \sin x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$ in $(0, 4\pi)$ are $x = 2\pi$ and $x = 3\pi$

9) Therefore, $n = 3$ and $\alpha_1 = \pi$

10) We need to calculate $n\alpha_1 - ab$:
    $3\pi - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3\pi}{2} = 3\pi - \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{9\pi}{4}$

Therefore, $q = 9$, $p = 4$, and $p + q = 13$.
