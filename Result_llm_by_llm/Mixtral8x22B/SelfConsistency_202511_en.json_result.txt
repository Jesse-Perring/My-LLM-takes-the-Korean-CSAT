Solution:
The given problem is to find the value of $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$. To solve this, we will simplify the expression step by step using the properties of exponents.

First, we know that $\sqrt[3]{5}$ can be written as $5^{\frac{1}{3}}$ because the cube root is the same as raising to the power of $\frac{1}{3}$. Also, $25$ can be written as $5^2$. So, we can rewrite the expression as:

$5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times (5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}}$

Next, we apply the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$. This gives us:

$5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}$

Simplifying the exponent, we get:

$5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$

Now, we apply the product rule for exponents, which states that $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$. This gives us:

$5^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}}$

Simplifying the exponent further, we get:

$5^{\frac{3}{3}}$

Since $\frac{3}{3} = 1$, we have:

$5^1$

Therefore, the value of $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is $5$.

Solution:
The given problem asks for the value of the limit as h approaches 0 of the expression [f(2+h) - f(2)]/h, where f(x) is a given function. This expression is actually the definition of the derivative of f(x) at x=2.

To find the derivative of f(x), we use the power rule for differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1). Applying this rule to each term in f(x), we find that the derivative f'(x) is equal to 3x^2 - 8.

Next, we evaluate f'(x) at x=2 to find the value of the derivative at this point. Plugging in x=2, we get f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4.

Therefore, the value of the given limit is equal to the value of the derivative of f(x) at x=2, which is 4.
Answer: $4$

[문제 3] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem states that we have a geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ where both the first term and the common ratio are equal to a positive number $k$. This means that each term in the sequence can be expressed as $a_n = k^n$.

Given the equation $$ \frac{a_4}{a_2}+\frac{a_2}{a_1}=30 $$, we substitute the expressions for $a_4$, $a_2$, and $a_1$ in terms of $k$ to get:

$$ \frac{k^4}{k^2}+\frac{k^2}{k}=30 $$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$ k^2 + k = 30 $$

Rearranging the equation, we have:

$$ k^2 + k - 30 = 0 $$

This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:

$$ (k + 6)(k - 5) = 0 $$

Since $k$ is a positive number, we discard the negative root and take $k = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $k$ is $5$.

[문제 4] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem asks for the value of the constant $a$ that makes the function $f(x)$ continuous for all real numbers. To find this value, we need to ensure that the function is continuous at the point where the two pieces of the function meet, which is at $x = -2$.

For a function to be continuous at a point, the limit of the function as $x$ approaches that point from both sides must exist and be equal to the value of the function at that point. In this case, we need to ensure that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $-2$ from the left is equal to the value of $f(x)$ at $x = -2$.

First, we find the value of $f(x)$ at $x = -2$ using the second piece of the function, since $x = -2$ falls within the domain $x \geq -2$. This gives us $f(-2) = (-2)^2 - a = 4 - a$.

Next, we find the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $-2$ from the left using the first piece of the function. This gives us $\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^-} (5x + a) = 5(-2) + a = -10 + a$.

For $f(x)$ to be continuous at $x = -2$, these two expressions must be equal. Setting them equal to each other and solving for $a$, we get $4 - a = -10 + a$, which simplifies to $2a = 14$ and further simplifies to $a = 7$.

Therefore, the value of the constant $a$ that makes the function $f(x)$ continuous for all real numbers is $7$.

[문제 5] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem asks for the value of the derivative of the function $f(x) = (x^2 + 1)(3x^2 - x)$ at $x = 1$, denoted as $f'(1)$. To find this, we first need to find the derivative of $f(x)$ using the product rule, which states that if $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, then $f'(x) = g'(x)h(x) + g(x)h'(x)$.

Let $g(x) = x^2 + 1$ and $h(x) = 3x^2 - x$. We then find the derivatives of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$:
- $g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 1) = 2x$
- $h'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(3x^2 - x) = 6x - 1$

Using the product rule, we get:
$f'(x) = g'(x)h(x) + g(x)h'(x)$
$f'(x) = (2x)(3x^2 - x) + (x^2 + 1)(6x - 1)$

We simplify the expression for $f'(x)$:
$f'(x) = 6x^3 - 2x^2 + 6x^3 - x^2 + 6x - 1$
$f'(x) = 12x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 1$

Finally, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x = 1$:
$f'(1) = 12(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 6(1) - 1$
$f'(1) = 12 - 3 + 6 - 1$
$f'(1) = 14$

Therefore, the value of $f'(1)$ is $14$.

해설:

이 문제는 삼각함수의 공식과 파이타고라스 정리를 이용하여 해결할 수 있습니다.

먼저, 주어진 식 $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta\right)=-\frac{1}{5}$에 삼각함수의 합과 차 공식을 적용합니다. 삼각함수의 합과 차 공식에 따르면 $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta$입니다. 이를 이용하여 $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \theta\right)$를 계산하면 다음과 같습니다:

\[
\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \theta\right) = \cos \frac{\pi}{2} \cos \theta - \sin \frac{\pi}{2} \sin \theta
\]

이때, $\cos \frac{\pi}{2} = 0$이고 $\sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1$이므로 식은 다음과 같이 단순화됩니다:

\[
-\frac{1}{5} = 0 \cdot \cos \theta - 1 \cdot \sin \theta = -\sin \theta
\]

따라서, $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$입니다.

다음으로, $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$의 값을 구하는 것이 목표입니다. 파이타고라스 정리에 따르면 $1 - \cos^2 \theta = \sin^2 \theta$이므로 식은 다음과 같이 변형됩니다:

\[
\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}
\]

이전에 구한 대로 $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$이므로 식은 다음과 같이 계산됩니다:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{5}} = 5
\]

따라서, $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$의 값은 $5$입니다.

이 문제는 삼각함수의 공식과 파이타고라스 정리를 이용하여 해결할 수 있는 기본적인 문제입니다. 주어진 식을 삼각함수의 합과 차 공식으로 변형하고, 파이타고라스 정리를 이용하여 식을 단순화하는 과정을 통해 문제를 해결할 수 있습니다.

Solution:
해설: 문제에서 주어진 다항식 함수 $f(x)$는 모든 실수 $x$에 대해 다음이 성립한다고 가정합니다.

\[ \int_0^x f(t) dt = 3x^3 + 2x \]

우리가 $f(1)$의 값을 찾으려면 $f(x)$의 식을 먼저 찾아야 합니다. 우리는 $f(x)$의 적분이 $0$에서 $x$까지 $3x^3 + 2x$와 같다는 것을 알고 있습니다. $f(x)$를 찾기 위해서는 $x$에 대해 양변을 미분해야 합니다.

미분의 정의에 따르면 왼쪽의 미분은 단순히 $f(x)$입니다. 이는 기본적인 적분 정리에 의해 성립합니다. 기본적인 적분 정리는 $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt$인 경우 $F'(x) = f(x)$임을 말합니다.

오른쪽의 미분은 미분의 승법을 사용하여 구할 수 있습니다. $3x^3$의 미분은 $9x^2$이고, $2x$의 미분은 $2$입니다. 따라서 $3x^3 + 2x$의 미분은 $9x^2 + 2$입니다.

따라서 다음과 같습니다.

\[f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} (3x^3 + 2x) = 9x^2 + 2\]

이제 $f(x)$의 식을 구했으므로 $f(1)$을 구하기 위해 $x = 1$을 식에 대입하면 됩니다.

\[f(1) = 9(1)^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11\]

따라서 $f(1)$의 값은 $11$입니다.

문제 8:
[문제 8] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem asks for the value of the product of two expressions involving logarithms, $a$ and $b$, where $a=2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}+\log_2 20$ and $b=\log 2$. To find the value of $a \times b$, we first simplify $a$ and then multiply it by $b$.

First, we simplify $a$:
1. We use the property of logarithms that $\log \frac{1}{x} = -\log x$ to rewrite the first term of $a$: $2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} = 2 \log 10^{-\frac{1}{2}} = -\log 10$.
2. We use the change of base formula $\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}$ to rewrite the second term of $a$ in base 10: $\log_2 20 = \frac{\log 20}{\log 2}$.
3. Combining the simplified terms, we get $a = -\log 10 + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2}$.
4. Since $\log 10 = 1$ and $\log 20 = \log (2 \cdot 10) = \log 2 + \log 10 = \log 2 + 1$, we can further simplify $a$ to $\frac{1}{\log 2}$.

Now, given $b = \log 2$, we can find $a \times b$:
\[a \times b = \frac{1}{\log 2} \times \log 2 = 1\]

Therefore, the value of $a \times b$ is $1$.
Answer: $1$


문제 9:
[문제 9] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem asks for the positive value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $$\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx = \int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx$$ given the function $f(x) = 3x^2 - 16x - 20$.

To solve this, we first find the antiderivative of $f(x)$, which is $F(x) = x^3 - 8x^2 - 20x + C$. Then, we substitute $F(x)$ into the given equation and simplify, which leads to the equation $a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a = 0$.

Factoring out $a$ from the left side of the equation, we get $a(a^2 - 8a - 20) = 0$. Factoring the quadratic expression inside the parentheses, we find $a(a - 10)(a + 2) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero, we find the possible values of $a$: $a = 0$, $a = 10$, and $a = -2$.

Since we are looking for the positive value of $a$, we discard $a = 0$ and $a = -2$. Therefore, the positive value of $a$ that satisfies the given equation is $a = 10$.
Answer: $10$

[문제 10] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem involves finding the minimum value of the sum of two natural numbers, $a$ and $b$, given that they are parameters of the function $f(x) = a \cos bx + 3$, which has a maximum value of 13 at $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$.

First, we use the given maximum value of $f(x)$ to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$. Since $f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 13$, we can write the equation $a \cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) + 3 = 13$. Solving for $a$, we get $a = \frac{10}{\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right)}$.

Next, we determine the range of $b$ by considering the period of the cosine function. The period of $\cos bx$ must be a divisor of $2\pi$, which implies that $b$ must be a natural number.

To find the minimum value of $a + b$, we need to minimize $a$ since $b$ is a natural number. The cosine function $\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right)$ reaches its maximum value of 1 when $b$ is a multiple of 6. Therefore, the smallest value of $b$ that satisfies this condition is $b = 6$. Substituting $b = 6$ into the equation for $a$, we find that $a = 10$.

Finally, we calculate the minimum value of $a + b$ as $10 + 6 = 16$. Therefore, the minimum value of $a + b$ for the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ is $16$.
Answer: $16$


문제 11:
[문제 11] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem asks for the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes after departure. To find this, we first need to determine the velocity of point P and then differentiate it to find the acceleration.

The velocity \(v\) of point P at time \(t\) is given by the derivative of its position \(x\) with respect to time \(t\):

$$ v = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( t^3 - \frac{3}{2} t^2 - 6t \right) $$

Using the power rule for differentiation, we find the velocity:

$$ v = 3t^2 - 3t - 6 $$

To find the time when the direction of motion changes, we need to find the time when the velocity is zero, as the velocity is positive when moving in the positive direction and negative when moving in the negative direction. Setting \(v = 0\), we get:

$$ 3t^2 - 3t - 6 = 0 $$

Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots \(t = 2\) and \(t = -1\). Since \(t \geq 0\), we discard \(t = -1\). Therefore, the direction of motion changes at \(t = 2\).

To find the acceleration at this time, we differentiate the velocity \(v\) with respect to time \(t\):

$$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 3t^2 - 3t - 6 \right) $$

Using the power rule again, we find the acceleration:

$$ a = 6t - 3 $$

Substituting \(t = 2\) into the acceleration equation, we get:

$$ a = 6(2) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 $$

Therefore, the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes is \(9\).

Solution:
The given problem involves two sequences, $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, with $a_1=2$ and $b_1=2$, and $\{b_n\}$ being an arithmetic sequence. We are given that for all natural numbers $n$, the sum of the ratios of the terms of $\{a_n\}$ to the corresponding terms of $\{b_n\}$ equals $\frac{1}{2}n^2$. We need to find the value of $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k$.

First, we express $b_{k+1}$ in terms of the common difference $d$ of the arithmetic sequence $\{b_n\}$, which gives us $b_{k+1} = 2 + kd$. Substituting this into the given equation, we get $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{2 + kd} = \frac{1}{2}n^2$.

For $n=1$, we find that $d=2$, which allows us to simplify the equation to $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{k+1} = n^2$. By substituting $n=1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $5$ into this equation, we can find the values of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,$ and $a_5$, respectively.

Finally, we calculate the sum $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 2 + 9 + 20 + 35 + 54 = 120$.

Therefore, the value of $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k$ is $120$.

Solution:
The problem involves finding a cubic function that satisfies certain conditions and then using that function to calculate the difference in area between two regions.

First, we express the cubic function as $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ and use the given conditions to set up a system of equations. We know that $f(1) = f(2) = 0$ and $f'(0) = -7$. This gives us the following equations:

1. $1 + a + b + c = 0$
2. $8 + 4a + 2b + c = 0$
3. $f'(0) = b = -7$

Solving this system of equations, we find that $a = 3$, $b = -7$, and $c = 3$. Therefore, the cubic function is $f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - 7x + 3$.

Next, we find the coordinates of point Q, which is the intersection of the curve $y = f(x)$ and the segment OP other than P. We set up the equation $\frac{f(3)}{3}x = f(x)$ and solve for $x$ to find that $x = 1$. Therefore, the coordinates of Q are $(1, f(1)) = (1, 0)$.

Now we can calculate the areas $A$ and $B$. The area $A$ is enclosed by the curve $y = f(x)$, the y-axis, and the segment OQ. We find that $A = \int_{0}^{1} f(x) dx = \frac{5}{4}$. The area $B$ is enclosed by the curve $y = f(x)$ and the segment PQ. We find that $B = \int_{1}^{3} f(x) dx = \frac{105}{4}$.

Therefore, the value of $B - A$ is $\frac{105}{4} - \frac{5}{4} = 25$.

So, the final answer is $B - A = 25$.

Solution:
The solution involves several steps to find the maximum area of triangle PBC for a point P on circle O.

1. First, we establish the ratio of the segments AD and DB as 3:2, which leads to AD = 3x and DB = 2x for some x > 0.
2. Using the given ratio of sine values for angles A and C, we apply the Law of Sines to find the ratio of the sides opposite to these angles in triangle ABC. This gives us the relationship between sides AB (c) and AC (b) as b/c = 8/5.
3. Since triangles ADE and ABC are similar, we find the ratio of AE to AC as 3/5, which implies AE = (3/5)b.
4. The ratio of the areas of triangles ADE and ABC is given as 9:35. However, this leads to a contradiction when compared to the previously established ratios. Correcting this, we find that the correct ratio of the areas should be (3/5)^2 = 9/25.
5. With the circumradius of triangle ABC given as 7, we use the Law of Sines to find the length of side BC. This calculation involves the sine value of angle A, which is derived from the given ratio of sine values for angles A and C.
6. To find the maximum area of triangle PBC, we consider the point P on circle O that is farthest from BC, which occurs when P is on the opposite side of the diameter from BC. The maximum height of triangle PBC is then the radius of circle O, which is AD = 3x.
7. The maximum area of triangle PBC is calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, which involves the base BC and the height AD.
8. To find the value of x, we use the relationship between the circumradius, side AB, and side AC. Solving for x, we get x = sqrt(14)/10.
9. Finally, substituting the value of x into the expression for the maximum area of triangle PBC, we get the desired result.

Therefore, the maximum area of triangle PBC for a point P on circle O is 84√14/65.
Answer: The maximum area of triangle PBC for a point P on circle O is $\frac{84\sqrt{14}}{65}$


문제 15:
[문제 15] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem asks for the value of $g(-2) + g(2)$ given a piecewise function $g(x)$ and certain conditions. To find this value, we first analyze the given conditions and the properties of the function.

1. Since $g(x)$ is differentiable for all real numbers, its derivative $g'(x)$ exists and is continuous for all $x$.
2. The equation $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$ having 4 distinct real roots implies that $g'(x)$ has 2 distinct real roots, and $g'(x-4)$ also has 2 distinct real roots, but shifted 4 units to the right.

Given the piecewise definition of $g(x)$, we find the derivative for $x \leq 0$:
$$g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + 15$$

For $g'(x)$ to have 2 distinct real roots, its discriminant $\Delta$ must be greater than 0:
$$\Delta = (2a)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 15 > 0$$
$$4a^2 - 180 > 0$$
$$a^2 > 45$$

Since $a \neq 3\sqrt{5}$, we have $a > 3\sqrt{5}$ or $a < -3\sqrt{5}$.

Next, we calculate $g(-2)$:
$$g(-2) = (-2)^3 + a(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 7 = 4a - 31$$

For $x > 0$, $g(x) = f(x)$, a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, making it decreasing for $x > 0$. However, we don't need to find the exact expression for $f(x)$ to find $g(2)$.

Since $g(x)$ is differentiable for all real numbers, it is continuous at $x = 0$. This means $g(0)$ is the same for both pieces of the function, which is $7$.

Given that $f(x)$ is decreasing for $x > 0$, $g(2) = f(2)$ will be less than $f(0) = 7$. Therefore, $g(-2) + g(2) < 4a - 24$, where $a > 3\sqrt{5}$.

However, without the exact value of $a$, we cannot determine the exact value of $g(-2) + g(2)$. The answer is that the value of $g(-2) + g(2)$ is less than $4a - 24$, where $a > 3\sqrt{5}$.
Answer: The value of $g(-2) + g(2)$ is less than $4a - 24$, where $a > 3\sqrt{5}$. Without the exact value of $a$, we cannot determine the exact value of $g(-2) + g(2)$


문제 16:
[문제 16] (배점: 3)
Solution:
### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Change of Base Formula**: To solve the equation $\log_2(x-3) = \log_4(3x-5)$, we use the change of base formula for logarithms, which is $\log_a(b) = \frac{\log_c(b)}{\log_c(a)}$. Applying this formula to both sides of the equation, we get:
   $$\frac{\log_2(x-3)}{\log_2(2)} = \frac{\log_2(3x-5)}{\log_2(4)}$$

2. **Simplification**: Since $\log_2(2) = 1$ and $\log_2(4) = 2$, we can simplify the equation to:
   $$\log_2(x-3) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3x-5)$$

3. **Using Logarithm Properties**: Using the property of logarithms that $\log_a(b^c) = c\log_a(b)$, we can rewrite the right side of the equation as:
   $$\log_2(x-3) = \log_2((3x-5)^{\frac{1}{2}})$$

4. **Equating Arguments**: Since the bases of the logarithms are the same, we can equate the arguments:
   $$x-3 = (3x-5)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

5. **Eliminating the Square Root**: Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get:
   $$(x-3)^2 = 3x-5$$

6. **Expanding and Rearranging**: Expanding the left side and rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
   $$x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0$$

7. **Factoring the Quadratic Equation**: Factoring the quadratic equation, we find:
   $$(x-2)(x-7) = 0$$

8. **Finding Solutions**: Setting each factor equal to zero, we find the possible solutions for $x$:
   $$x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 7$$

9. **Checking Solutions**: However, we must check that each solution satisfies the original equation and the conditions for the logarithms to be defined. For $x=2$, we find that $\log_2(2-3)$ is undefined, so $x=2$ is not a valid solution. For $x=7$, we find that the equation holds true, so $x=7$ is a valid solution.

### Conclusion

The only valid solution to the equation $\log_2(x-3) = \log_4(3x-5)$ is $x = 7$.

[문제 17] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem asks for the value of the polynomial function $f(x)$ at $x=2$, given its derivative $f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x$ and the value of $f(1) = 6$.

To find the original function $f(x)$, we integrate the given derivative $f'(x)$. The antiderivative of $9x^2$ is $3x^3$ and the antiderivative of $4x$ is $2x^2$. Therefore, the antiderivative of $f'(x)$ is $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.

Using the given information that $f(1) = 6$, we can find the value of $C$:

\[f(1) = 3(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + C = 3 + 2 + C = 6\]

Solving for $C$, we get $C = 1$.

Now that we have the value of $C$, we can write the complete expression for $f(x)$:

\[f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1\]

To find $f(2)$, we substitute $x = 2$ into the expression for $f(x)$:

\[f(2) = 3(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 1 = 3(8) + 2(4) + 1 = 24 + 8 + 1 = 33\]

Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is $33$.

$$\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + (a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8) + (a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12}) + (a_{13} + a_{14} + a_{15} + a_{16})$$

이제 각각의 4개씩 묶인 그룹에 대해 주어진 조건을 적용해보겠습니다.

- 첫 번째 그룹인 $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4$에 대해, $a_1 + a_5 = 12$와 $a_2 + a_6 = 12$이므로, $a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + a_6 = 24$입니다.
- 두 번째 그룹인 $a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8$에 대해, $a_3 + a_7 = 12$와 $a_4 + a_8 = 12$이므로, $a_3 + a_4 + a_7 + a_8 = 24$입니다.
- 세 번째 그룹인 $a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12}$에 대해, $a_9 + a_{13} = 12$와 $a_{10} + a_{14} = 12$이므로, $a_9 + a_{10} + a_{13} + a_{14} = 24$입니다.
- 네 번째 그룹인 $a_{13} + a_{14} + a_{15} + a_{16}$에 대해, $a_{11} + a_{15} = 12$와 $a_{12} + a_{16} = 12$이므로, $a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{15} + a_{16} = 24$입니다.

이제 각각의 그룹에 대한 결과를 더하면, $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n = 24 + 24 + 24 + 24 = 96$입니다.

따라서, $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n$의 값은 $96$입니다.
Answer: $\boxed{96}$


문제 19:
[문제 19] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem asks for the value of \(f(3)\) given that the maximum value of \(f(x) = 2x^3 - 3a x^2 - 12a^2 x\) is \(\frac{7}{27}\) for positive \(a\). To find this, we first need to determine the value of \(a\) and then substitute \(x = 3\) into the function.

1. **Finding the derivative of \(f(x)\):**

   The derivative of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(2x^3 - 3ax^2 - 12a^2x) = 6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2.
   \]

2. **Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:**

   To find the critical points, we set \(f'(x) = 0\):
   \[
   6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2 = 0.
   \]
   Dividing the entire equation by \(6\) gives us:
   \[
   x^2 - ax - 2a^2 = 0.
   \]

3. **Solving for \(x\):**

   Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots of the equation:
   \[
   x = \frac{a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 8a^2}}{2} = \frac{a \pm 3a}{2}.
   \]
   This results in two critical points:
   \[
   x_1 = -2a, \quad x_2 = 2a.
   \]

4. **Determining the nature of the critical points:**

   To determine the nature of the critical points, we examine the sign of \(f'(x)\) around the critical points. Since \(f'(x) = 6(x + 2a)(x - 2a)\), we see that \(f'(x) > 0\) for \(x < -2a\) and \(x > 2a\), and \(f'(x) < 0\) for \(-2a < x < 2a\). This means that \(f(x)\) is increasing on \((-\infty, -2a)\) and \((2a, \infty)\), and decreasing on \((-2a, 2a)\). Therefore, \(x = 2a\) is a local maximum.

5. **Finding the value of \(a\):**

   Since the maximum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{7}{27}\), we have:
   \[
   f(2a) = 2(2a)^3 - 3a(2a)^2 - 12a^2(2a) = \frac{7}{27}.
   \]
   Simplifying this equation gives us:
   \[
   16a^3 - 12a^3 - 24a^3 = \frac{7}{27}.
   \]
   This simplifies further to:
   \[
   -8a^3 = \frac{7}{27}.
   \]
   Solving for \(a\), we find:
   \[
   a = -\left(\frac{7}{27 \cdot 8}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = -\frac{1}{3}.
   \]

6. **Finding \(f(3)\):**

   With \(a = -\frac{1}{3}\), we substitute \(x = 3\) into \(f(x)\):
   \[
   f(3) = 2(3)^3 - 3\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)(3)^2 - 12\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2(3) = 54 + 3 + 4 = 61.
   \]

Therefore, the value of \(f(3)\) is \(61\).
Answer: $61$


문제 20:
[문제 20] (배점: 4)
Solution:
To find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$, we first need to determine the value of $k$, which is the x-coordinate of the intersection point of the curve $y=\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ and the line $y=x$. By setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for $x$, we find that the equation does not have an elementary solution. However, using numerical methods or graphing, we can approximate the value of $k$ to be $k \approx 2.3026$.

Next, we know that for all $x > k$, $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$. We also know that $f(f(x)) = 3x$. To find $f(k)$, we substitute $k$ into the equation for $f(x)$ and approximate the value to be $f(k) \approx 3$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Since $\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} < k$, we cannot use the given function definition for $f(x)$ to find $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Instead, we use the property $f(f(x)) = 3x$.

Let $t = \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$. Then, we have $f(t) = f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Since $f(f(x)) = 3x$, we can write $f(f(t)) = 3t$. Substituting $t = \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$, we get $f\left(f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)\right) = 3 \times \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$.

Using the property $f(f(x)) = 3x$ again, we find that $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \times f\left(f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)\right) = \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$.

Therefore, the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$ is $\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$. Using the approximate value of $k \approx 2.3026$, we can calculate the approximate value of $\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$ to be $1.11 \times 10^{-10}$.

Thus, the approximate value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$ is $1.11 \times 10^{-10}$.
Answer: $1.11 \times 10^{-10}$

[문제 21] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem asks for the maximum value of $f(1)$ given the function $f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + 4$ and the condition that the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(2x+1)}{f(x)}$ exists for all real $\alpha$.

First, we find the expression for $\frac{f(2x+1)}{f(x)}$ and simplify it. We then consider the case when $a = 0$, which simplifies the function to $f(x) = x^3 + bx + 4$. The expression for $\frac{f(2x+1)}{f(x)}$ in this case is $\frac{8x^3 + 12x^2 + (6 + 2b)x + (b + 5)}{x^3 + bx + 4}$.

Since the limit must exist for all real $\alpha$, we need to ensure that the denominator $f(x)$ is not zero at $x = 0$. This condition is always true for $a = 0$, so it is a valid choice.

Now, we find the maximum value of $f(1)$ when $a = 0$, which is $f(1) = 5 + b$. Since $b$ is an integer, the maximum value of $f(1)$ occurs when $b$ is maximized. However, we do not have any constraints on the value of $b$ other than it being an integer. Therefore, the maximum value of $f(1)$ is not uniquely determined by the given conditions.

In conclusion, the maximum value of $f(1)$ cannot be uniquely determined with the given conditions. The answer is that the maximum value of $f(1)$ cannot be uniquely determined with the given conditions.
Answer: The maximum value of $f(1)$ cannot be uniquely determined with the given conditions


문제 22:
[문제 22] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem asks for the sum of all possible values of |a₁| for all integer sequences {a_n} that satisfy the given conditions.

First, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. Condition (a) states that for all natural numbers n, a_(n+1) is defined based on the parity of |a_n|. If |a_n| is odd, then a_(n+1) = a_n - 3. If a_n = 0 or |a_n| is even, then a_(n+1) = 1/2 * a_n.

2. Condition (b) states that the smallest natural number m such that |a_m| = |a_(m+2)| is 3.

Now, let's find the general term of the sequence {a_n} based on condition (a):

- If a_n is odd, then a_(n+1) = a_n - 3. By induction, we can see that a_(n+k) = a_n - 3k.
- If a_n is even, then a_(n+1) = 1/2 * a_n. By induction, we can see that a_(n+k) = 1/2^k * a_n.

Next, let's analyze condition (b):

- Since the smallest natural number m such that |a_m| = |a_(m+2)| is 3, a₁ must be either odd or 0. If a₁ were even, then a₂ = 1/2 * a₁ would also be even, and a₃ = 1/4 * a₁ would be even as well, which contradicts condition (b).

Now, let's find the possible values of a₁ based on the above analysis:

- If a₁ is odd, then a₂ = a₁ - 3 is even, and a₃ = a₂ - 3 = a₁ - 6 is odd. By induction, we can see that a_(2k-1) = a₁ - 3(2k-2) is odd, and a_(2k) = a₁ - 3(2k-1) is even. Therefore, a_(2k-1) = a_(2k+1), which means m = 2k-1. Since m = 3, we have k = 2, and a₁ = 3.
- If a₁ = 0, then a₂ = 0 and a₃ = 0, which satisfies condition (b).

Therefore, the possible values of a₁ are 0 and 3. The sum of their absolute values is |0| + |3| = 3.

Hence, the answer is $3$.
Answer: $3$

[문제 23] (배점: 2)
Solution:
The given problem asks for the value of the limit as x approaches 0 of the expression (3x^2)/(sin^2 x). To solve this, we can use a trigonometric identity and a known limit.

First, recall the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x)/x equals 1. This is a well-known limit that is often used in calculus.

Next, we can rewrite the given limit as the product of 3 and two instances of (x/sin x). This is done by factoring out the 3 and then rearranging the terms in the denominator.

Using the trigonometric identity mentioned earlier, we can rewrite the expression inside the limit as the product of 3 and two instances of (1/((sin x)/x)). This is done by taking the reciprocal of the expression (sin x)/x and then multiplying it by 3.

Since the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x)/x equals 1, we can substitute this value into the expression. This gives us the product of 3 and two instances of 1, which simplifies to 3.

Therefore, the value of the limit as x approaches 0 of (3x^2)/(sin^2 x) is 3.
Answer: $\boxed{3}$

Solution:
해설: 이 문제는 적분을 이용하여 주어진 함수의 값을 구하는 것입니다. 먼저 적분 식 $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx$를 살펴보겠습니다. 이 식에서 분자를 $x + 1 + 1$로 나타내면 분모와 같은 항이 생기므로 분수를 두 개의 분수로 나눌 수 있습니다. 따라서 다음과 같이 적분 식을 변형할 수 있습니다:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \left( \frac{x+1}{x+1} + \frac{1}{x+1} \right) dx$$

이제 분자와 분모가 같은 분수는 1이 되므로 다음과 같이 적분 식을 더 간단하게 나타낼 수 있습니다:

$$= \int_0^{10} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x+1} \right) dx$$

이제 이 적분 식을 두 개의 적분으로 나누어 계산할 수 있습니다:

$$= \int_0^{10} 1 dx + \int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx$$

첫 번째 적분은 상수 함수 $y = 1$의 면적을 구하는 것으로 0에서 10까지의 넓이는 10이 됩니다. 두 번째 적분은 변수 변환을 이용하여 계산할 수 있습니다. $u = x + 1$로 변환하면 $du = dx$가 되고, 적분 한계는 $u = 1$에서 $u = 11$까지가 됩니다. 따라서 다음과 같이 적분 식을 변형할 수 있습니다:

$$= 10 + \int_1^{11} \frac{1}{u} du$$

이제 이 적분을 계산하면 다음과 같이 나옵니다:

$$= 10 + \ln|u| \bigg|_1^{11}$$

$$= 10 + \ln(11) - \ln(1)$$

$\ln(1) = 0$이므로 다음과 같이 적분 식을 계산할 수 있습니다:

$$= 10 + \ln(11)$$

따라서 이 적분의 값은 $10 + \ln(11)$입니다.
Answer: $10 + \ln(11)$

이 문제에서는 수열 $\{a_n\}$에 대해 $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}=1$이 주어졌을 때, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$의 값을 찾아야 합니다.

먼저, 주어진 극한을 분석해 봅시다. $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}=1$은 $n$이 무한대로 가까워질수록 $a_n$이 $\frac{n^2+3}{n}$와 같이 행동한다는 것을 의미합니다. 이는 $n + \frac{3}{n}$로 단순화될 수 있으며, $\frac{3}{n}$는 $n$이 증가함에 따라 무시할 수 있을 정도로 작아집니다. 따라서 큰 $n$에 대해 $a_n$은 $n$과 근사적으로 같습니다.

이제 찾고자 하는 극한을 살펴보겠습니다. $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$를 단순화하기 위해 분자와 분모에 이 식의 덧셈 공식을 적용합니다. 이렇게 하면 다음과 같이 나옵니다:

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n\right)}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}\right)$$

분자를 단순화하면 다음과 같습니다:

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{a_n^2+n-a_n^2}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}\right)$$

이는 다음과 같이 더 단순화될 수 있습니다:

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}\right)$$

$a_n$이 큰 $n$에 대해 $n$과 근사적으로 같다는 것을 고려하면 이 식에서 $a_n$을 $n$으로 대체할 수 있습니다:

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2+n}+n}\right)$$

이 식을 더 단순화하기 위해 분모에서 $n$을 공약으로 빼내면 다음과 같습니다:

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}+1}\right)$$

$n$이 무한대로 가까워질수록 $\frac{1}{n}$은 0에 가까워지므로 제곱근 내의 식은 1에 가까워집니다:

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1}+1}\right)$$

이는 다음과 같이 단순화될 수 있습니다:

$$\frac{1}{2}$$

따라서 $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$의 값은 $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$입니다.
Answer: $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$


문제 26:
[문제 26] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem involves finding the volume of a solid with a base enclosed by a curve, the x-axis, and two vertical lines. The cross-sections of the solid perpendicular to the x-axis are squares. To find the volume, we first understand the shape of the base and then integrate the area of the square cross-sections over the interval [1, e].

The base of the solid is enclosed by the curve y = √[(x+1)/(x(x+ln(x)))], the x-axis, and the lines x = 1 and x = e. This means that for any given x-value within the interval [1, e], the height of the solid at that x-value is given by the y-value of the curve.

Since every cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis is a square, the side length of each square cross-section is equal to the height of the solid at that x-value. Therefore, the area of each square cross-section is the square of the height of the solid at that x-value.

To find the volume of the solid, we integrate the area of the square cross-sections over the interval [1, e]. This can be done using the formula for the volume of a solid of revolution, which is V = ∫[a, b] A(x) dx, where A(x) is the area of the cross-section at x and [a, b] is the interval over which we are integrating.

In this case, the area of the cross-section at x is A(x) = y^2 = (x+1)/(x(x+ln(x))). Therefore, the volume of the solid is given by the integral:

V = ∫[1, e] (x+1)/(x(x+ln(x))) dx

To evaluate this integral, we can use the method of substitution. Let u = x + ln(x). Then du = (1 + 1/x) dx, and we can rewrite the integral as:

V = ∫[1, e] (1/u) du

This integral is straightforward to evaluate, and we find that:

V = ln(u) |[1, e] = ln(e) - ln(1) = 1

Therefore, the volume of the solid is 1 cubic unit.

문제 27:
[문제 27] (배점: 3)
Solution:
The problem involves analyzing a cubic function $f(x)$ and its transformation $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x$. We are given that the tangent to the curve $y = g(x)$ at the point $(0, g(0))$ is the $x$-axis, and $g(x)$ has an inverse function $h(x)$. The goal is to find the value of $h'(8)$.

First, we express $g(x)$ by substituting $e^x$ into $f(x)$, resulting in $g(x) = e^{3x} + ae^{2x} + be^x + c + e^x$. Next, we find the derivative $g'(x)$ using the chain rule and the derivative of $e^x$, which gives us $g'(x) = 3e^{3x} + 2ae^{2x} + be^x + e^x$.

Since the tangent to the curve $y = g(x)$ at $(0, g(0))$ is the $x$-axis, the slope of the tangent line at this point is $0$. Therefore, $g'(0) = 0$, which leads to the equation $2a + b = -4$. We also find $g(0) = 2 + a + b + c$.

Using the inverse function theorem, we know that if $g(x)$ has an inverse $h(x)$, then $h'(x) = \frac{1}{g'(h(x))}$. To find $h'(8)$, we need to find $g'(h(8))$. Given that $h(8) = 0$ if $2 + a + b + c = 8$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$ using the equations $2a + b = -4$ and $c = 6 - a - b$. This yields $a = -2$, $b = 0$, and $c = 8$.

Substituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into $g'(x)$, we get $g'(x) = 3e^{3x} - 4e^{2x} + e^x$. However, when we try to find $g'(0)$, we encounter a contradiction because $g'(0) = 0$, which implies that $h'(8)$ does not exist or is undefined.

Therefore, the value of $h'(8)$ is undefined.
Answer: $h'(8)$ is undefined

Solution:
The problem asks for the value of $g(1) + g'(1)$, where $g(t)$ is the area enclosed by the tangent to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $(t, f(t))$, the curve $y=f(x)$, and the $y$-axis. To find this, we first need to determine the derivative of $f(x)$, which is given as $f'(x) = -x + e^{1-x^2}$.

Next, we find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at the point $(t, f(t))$. The slope of the tangent line at this point is given by $f'(t) = -t + e^{1-t^2}$. The equation of the tangent line can be written as $y - f(t) = f'(t)(x - t)$. Substituting $f'(t) = -t + e^{1-t^2}$ and rearranging, we get the equation of the tangent line.

We then find the points of intersection of this tangent line with the curve $y=f(x)$ and the $y$-axis, denoted as $(a, f(a))$ and $(0, b)$, respectively. To find $a$, we set $y = f(x)$ and solve for $x$, using the derivative $f'(a) = -a + e^{1-a^2} = -t + e^{1-t^2}$. Solving for $a$, we find that $a = t$, which means the tangent line intersects the curve $y=f(x)$ at the point $(t, f(t))$. To find $b$, we set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$.

The area $g(t)$ enclosed by the tangent line, the curve $y=f(x)$, and the $y$-axis is given by the integral $\int_{0}^{t} [f(x) - (-t + e^{1-t^2})(x - t) - f(t)] dx$. To find $g(1)$, we substitute $t = 1$ into this equation and simplify. To find $g'(1)$, we differentiate $g(t)$ with respect to $t$ and substitute $t = 1$.

Finally, we find $g(1) + g'(1)$ by adding the expressions for $g(1)$ and $g'(1)$. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate this integral to find that $g(1) + g'(1) = f(1) - f(0)$.

Therefore, the value of $g(1) + g'(1)$ is $f(1) - f(0)$.
Answer: $f(1) - f(0)$

[문제 29] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem involves a geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ with a common ratio $q$. Given two conditions, we can deduce that the sum of the sequence $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \frac{20}{3}$ and $a_1 > 0$. This leads to the first term $a_1 = \frac{20}{3} \times (1 - q)$ and the constraint $0 < q < 1$.

The given inequality $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{2n} ((-1)^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}} \times a_{m+k}) > \frac{1}{700}$ can be simplified to a form involving the common ratio $q$ and the term $a_{m+1}$. By substituting the expression for $a_{m+1}$ and simplifying, we get an inequality involving $q^m$.

To find the range of $m$, we introduce a function $f(q) = \frac{(1 - q)^2}{1 - q^2} = \frac{1}{1 + q}$ and determine its range for $0 < q < 1$. This allows us to find a lower bound for $q^m$ and, consequently, an upper bound for $m$.

Given the constraint $q \in (0, 1)$, we find that $m < \log_{0.5} \frac{1}{4666} < 12$. Therefore, the possible values for $m$ are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 11$. The sum of all such $m$ is $1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 11 = 66$.

Hence, the answer is $66$.

[문제 30] (배점: 4)
Solution:
The problem provides a function $f(x) = \sin(ax + b + \sin x)$ with constants $a$ and $b$ satisfying certain conditions. We are asked to find the value of $p + q$ given that $n\alpha_1 - ab = \frac{q}{p}\pi$ where $p$ and $q$ are coprime natural numbers, $n$ is the number of elements in set $A$, and $\alpha_1$ is the smallest element of $A$.

First, we find the value of $b$ using the given condition $f(0) = 0$. Since $f(0) = \sin(b) = 0$, we conclude that $b = k\pi$ for some integer $k$. Using the condition $f(2\pi) = 2\pi a + b$, we find that $k = 0$, so $b = 0$.

Next, we find the value of $a$ using the given condition that the smallest positive $t$ such that $f'(0) = f'(t)$ is $4\pi$. By calculating the derivative $f'(x)$ and setting it equal to $f'(0)$, we find that $a = 1$.

With $a = 1$ and $b = 0$, the function simplifies to $f(x) = \sin(x + \sin x)$. To find the local maxima of $f(x)$, we set $f'(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$. We find that $x = k\pi$ for some integer $k$, and that $f(x)$ has a local minimum at $x = 0$, a local maximum at $x = 2\pi$, and a local minimum at $x = 4\pi$. Therefore, $A = \{2\pi\}$, $n = 1$, and $\alpha_1 = 2\pi$.

Finally, we calculate $n\alpha_1 - ab = 2\pi - 0 = 2\pi$, so $p = 1$ and $q = 2$. The answer is $p + q = 3$.
