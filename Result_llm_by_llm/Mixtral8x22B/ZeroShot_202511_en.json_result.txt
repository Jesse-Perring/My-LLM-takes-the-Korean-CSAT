문제 1:
To solve the problem, we start by expressing both terms under the same exponent:

$$\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

We know that $25$ is $5^2$, so we can rewrite $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ as $(5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Using the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^{m})^{n} = a^{mn}$, we get:

$$(5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5^{2 \times \frac{1}{3}} = 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$$

Now, we can combine the terms since they have the same base:

$$\sqrt[3]{5} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$$

Using the rule for multiplying powers with the same base, which states that $a^{m} \times a^{n} = a^{m+n}$, we add the exponents:

$$5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}} = 5^{1}$$

Therefore, the value of $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is:

$$5$$

문제 2:
To find the value of $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$, we recognize this as the definition of the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=2$. That is,

$$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h} = f'(2).$$

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 8x + 7$, we find the derivative $f'(x)$:

$$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^3) - \frac{d}{dx}(8x) + \frac{d}{dx}(7) = 3x^2 - 8.$$

Now, we evaluate $f'(2)$:

$$f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 8 = 3 \cdot 4 - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4.$$

Therefore, the value of $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$ is $4$.

문제 3:
Given that the geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ has both the first term and common ratio equal to a positive number $k$, we can express the terms of the sequence as $a_n = k^n$.

Given the equation $$\frac{a_4}{a_2}+\frac{a_2}{a_1}=30$$, we substitute the expressions for $a_4$, $a_2$, and $a_1$ in terms of $k$:

$$\frac{k^4}{k^2} + \frac{k^2}{k} = 30$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$k^2 + k = 30$$

Rearranging the equation to set it to zero, we have:

$$k^2 + k - 30 = 0$$

Factoring the quadratic equation, we find:

$$(k + 6)(k - 5) = 0$$

Since $k$ is a positive number, we discard the negative solution and take $k = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $k$ is $5$.

문제 4:
Since $f(x)$ is continuous for all real numbers,

Therefore, $$\begin{cases} \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) \\ \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = f(-2)\end{cases}$$,

Thus, $$\begin{cases} 5 \times (-2) + a = (-2)^2 - a \\ 5 \times (-2) + a = (-2)^2 - a\end{cases}$$,

Solving this, we get $a = 6$.

Therefore, the answer is $6$.

**Analysis:** According to the problem, $f(x)$ is continuous for all real numbers, which means $$\begin{cases} \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) \\ \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = f(-2)\end{cases}$$. By substituting the piecewise function, we can find the value of $a$.

문제 5:
Solution: Since $f(x)=(x^2+1)(3x^2-x)$,
we have $f'(x)=(x^2+1)'(3x^2-x)+(x^2+1)(3x^2-x)'=2x(3x^2-x)+(x^2+1)(6x-1)$,
thus $f'(1)=2\times1\times(3\times1^2-1)+(1^2+1)(6\times1-1)=2\times2+2\times5=14$.
Therefore, the answer is $14$.

**Analysis:** To find the derivative of the function, we use the product rule for differentiation. Then, we substitute $x=1$ into the derivative to find the value of $f'(1)$.

문제 6:
Given that $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta\right)=-\frac{1}{5}$, we can use the trigonometric identity $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta\right) = -\sin \theta$ to find the value of $\sin \theta$. Therefore, we have:

\[
-\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{5} \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$. We know that $1-\cos^2 \theta = \sin^2 \theta$ by the Pythagorean identity. Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}
\]

Substituting the value of $\sin \theta$ we found earlier:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{5}} = 5
\]

Therefore, the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$ is $5$.

문제 7:
To find the value of $f(1)$, we first need to find the expression for $f(x)$. Since we are given the integral of $f(x)$ from $0$ to $x$, we can find $f(x)$ by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to $x$.

Given:
$$ \int_0^x f(t) dt = 3x^3 + 2x $$

Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt$, then $F'(x) = f(x)$. Therefore, differentiating the left side gives us $f(x)$, and differentiating the right side gives us the derivative of $3x^3 + 2x$.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x f(t) dt \right) = \frac{d}{dx} (3x^3 + 2x) $$

$$ f(x) = 9x^2 + 2 $$

Now that we have the expression for $f(x)$, we can find $f(1)$ by substituting $x = 1$ into the expression.

$$ f(1) = 9(1)^2 + 2 $$

$$ f(1) = 9 + 2 $$

$$ f(1) = 11 $$

Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $11$.

문제 8:
Solution: Since $a=2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}+\log_2 20 = 2 \times (-1) + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2} = -2 + \frac{\log 2 + \log 10}{\log 2} = -2 + \frac{\log 2 + 1}{\log 2}$,

Therefore, $a \times b = (-2 + \frac{\log 2 + 1}{\log 2}) \times \log 2 = -2 \log 2 + \log 2 + 1 = 1 - \log 2$.

Hence, the answer is $1 - \log 2$.

By using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify $a$ and then calculate the value of $a \times b$.

This problem tests the understanding of logarithmic properties and computational skills. It is a basic question.

문제 9:
Solution: Since $f(x)=3x^2-16x-20$,
then $F(x)=x^3-8x^2-20x$,
thus $\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx = F(a) - F(-2) = a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a + 24$,
and $\int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx = F(0) - F(-2) = 24$,
therefore, $a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a = 0$,
solving this gives $a = 10$, $a = 0$, or $a = -2$ (discard this solution),
since $a > 0$,
thus $a = 10$.
Hence, the answer is $10$.

**Analysis:** By finding the antiderivative of the function, we can transform the definite integral into a function of $a$, and then solve for the value of $a$.

문제 10:
Given the function $f(x)=a \cos bx + 3$ defined on the closed interval $[0,2\pi]$, and knowing that $f(x)$ has a maximum value of 13 at $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$, we can start by setting up the equation based on the given information:

1. The maximum value of $f(x)$ is 13 at $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$, so we have:
\[a \cos\left(b \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 3 = 13\]

2. Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[a \cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = 10\]

3. Since $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers, and $a$ must be a factor of 10, the possible values for $a$ are 1, 2, 5, and 10. However, since $a$ is a natural number and $f(x)$ has a maximum value of 13, $a$ cannot be 10 because that would imply $f(x)$ has a maximum value of 13 at $x=0$, which is not the case. Therefore, $a$ can only be 1, 2, or 5.

4. For $a=1$, we have:
\[\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = 10\]
This is not possible since the cosine function's range is $[-1, 1]$.

5. For $a=2$, we have:
\[\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = 5\]
This is also not possible since the cosine function's range is $[-1, 1]$.

6. For $a=5$, we have:
\[\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = 2\]
This is still not possible since the cosine function's range is $[-1, 1]$.

7. However, considering the periodic nature of the cosine function and the given interval $[0,2\pi]$, we can adjust our approach. For $a=5$, we can find a suitable $b$ such that $\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{2}{5}$, which would satisfy the equation $5 \cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) + 3 = 13$.

8. Solving for $b$ in $\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{2}{5}$, we find that $b=1$ is a valid solution.

9. Therefore, the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ that satisfies the given conditions is $(5, 1)$.

10. The minimum value of $a+b$ for the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ is $5 + 1 = 6$.

Hence, the minimum value of $a+b$ for the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ is $6$.

문제 11:
Solution: Given $x = t^3 - \frac{3}{2} t^2 - 6t$,

Therefore, $x' = 3t^2 - 3t - 6$,

Let $x' = 0$, solving this gives $t = 2$ or $t = -1$ (discard this solution),

Therefore, $x'' = 6t - 3$,

Thus, the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes after departure is $6 \times 2 - 3 = 9$.

Hence, the answer is $9$.

This problem examines the application of derivatives in physics, where the derivative of displacement with respect to time is velocity, and the derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. It is a basic question.

문제 12:
Since the sequence $\{b_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with $b_1=2$ and $b_{k+1} = 2 + kd$,

we have $\frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{a_k}{2 + kd}$.

Given that $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$,

when $n=1$, we have $\frac{a_1}{b_2} = \frac{1}{2}$, which implies $a_1 = b_2$.

Since $b_1 = 2$ and $b_2 = 2 + d$, we have $d = 0$.

Therefore, $b_n = 2$ for all $n$.

Thus, $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \frac{1}{2} n^2$,

which implies $\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = n^2$.

Therefore, $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = 5^2 = 25$.

Hence, the answer is $25$.

**Analysis:** By utilizing the properties of arithmetic sequences and the given conditions, we can deduce that $b_n = 2$ for all $n$. This allows us to find the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence $\{a_n\}$, and thus the answer.

문제 13:
Given the cubic function $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ with leading coefficient 1, and the conditions $f(1) = f(2) = 0$ and $f'(0) = -7$, we aim to find the value of $B - A$, where $A$ is the area enclosed by the curve $y = f(x)$, the y-axis, and the segment $OQ$, and $B$ is the area enclosed by the curve $y = f(x)$ and the segment $PQ$.

First, we find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ using the given conditions:

1. From $f(1) = 0$, we have $1 + a + b + c = 0$.
2. From $f(2) = 0$, we have $8 + 4a + 2b + c = 0$.
3. From $f'(0) = -7$, we have $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b$, so $f'(0) = b = -7$.

Solving these equations, we find:
- Substituting $b = -7$ into the first two equations, we get $a + c = 8$ and $4a + c = 15$.
- Solving this system, we find $a = 1$ and $c = 7$.

Thus, the cubic function is $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 7x + 7$.

Next, we find the coordinates of point $Q$. Since $Q$ lies on the segment $OP$ and $P(3, f(3))$, we have $Q(3t, 3tf(3))$ for some $t \in (0, 1)$.

The area $A$ is given by the integral $\int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx$, and the area $B$ is given by the integral $\int_{3t}^{3} f(x) dx$.

To find $B - A$, we calculate the definite integral $\int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx$ and then subtract $2A$ from it:

$\int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx = \int_{0}^{3} (x^3 + x^2 - 7x + 7) dx = \left[\frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{7}{2}x^2 + 7x\right]_{0}^{3} = \frac{129}{4}$.

Since $B - A = \int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx - 2A$, and $2A = 2\int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx$, we have:

$B - A = \frac{129}{4} - 2\int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx$.

To find the value of $B - A$, we need to determine the value of $t$. However, since the exact value of $t$ is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact value of $B - A$.

Therefore, the final answer is encapsulated as $\text{Cannot be determined without the exact value of } t$.

문제 14:
To solve this problem, we follow a series of steps based on the given information and the properties of triangles and circles.

1. **Understanding the Given Ratio**: Given $\sin A: \sin C=8:5$, we can use the Law of Sines to find the ratio of the sides opposite these angles in triangle ABC. Since the Law of Sines states $\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin C}{c}$, we have $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{8}{5}$.

2. **Finding the Ratio of $\overline{AD}$ to $\overline{AC}$**: Since $\overline{AD}:\overline{DB}=3:2$, and $\overline{AB} = \overline{AD} + \overline{DB}$, we find that $\overline{AD}:\overline{AB} = 3:5$. Given $\overline{AB}:\overline{AC} = 8:5$ from the Law of Sines, we can combine these ratios to find $\overline{AD}:\overline{AC} = 24:25$.

3. **Using the Ratio of Areas**: The ratio of the areas of triangles ADE and ABC is given as $9:35$. The area of a triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. Since the base of both triangles is $\overline{AD}$, the ratio of their heights (which are perpendicular distances from A to BC and DE, respectively) is also $9:35$.

4. **Determining the Radius of Circle O**: The radius of circle O is equal to $\overline{AD}$. Since $\overline{AD}:\overline{AC} = 24:25$, and the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is 7, we find that $\overline{AC} = 25$ and thus $\overline{AD} = 24$.

5. **Finding the Length of $\overline{AE}$**: Using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle ADE, where $\overline{DE}$ is the height from A to BC, we have $\overline{AE}^2 = \overline{AD}^2 + \overline{DE}^2$. Given the ratio of heights is $9:35$, we find $\overline{DE} = \frac{9}{35} \times \overline{BC}$. Since $\overline{BC} = 2\overline{AC} \times \sin C = 2 \times 25 \times \frac{5}{13} = \frac{250}{13}$, we find $\overline{DE} = \frac{225}{13}$. Therefore, $\overline{AE}^2 = 24^2 + \left(\frac{225}{13}\right)^2$, leading to $\overline{AE} = \frac{150}{13}$.

6. **Calculating the Area of Triangle PBC**: The maximum area of triangle PBC occurs when P is at the point E, making triangle PBC a right triangle. The area is given by $\frac{1}{2} \times \overline{BC} \times \overline{BE}$. Since $\overline{BE} = \overline{AE} - \overline{AB} = \frac{150}{13} - 24 = \frac{18}{13}$, the maximum area is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{250}{13} \times \frac{18}{13} = \frac{2250}{169}$.

Therefore, the maximum area of triangle PBC for a point P on circle O is $\frac{2250}{169}$.

문제 15:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and find the value of $g(-2) + g(2)$. Let's break down the solution step by step.

1. **Understanding the conditions for $g(x)$:**

   Given that $g(x)$ is differentiable for all real numbers, we know that the derivative $g'(x)$ must exist and be continuous at all points. This implies that the piecewise function $g(x)$ must be continuous and smooth at $x=0$.

2. **Analyzing the derivative $g'(x)$:**

   For $x \leq 0$, the derivative of $g(x)$ is $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + 15$. For $x > 0$, since $g(x) = f(x)$ and $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, the derivative $g'(x) = f'(x)$ will be a linear function with a negative slope.

3. **Finding the roots of $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$:**

   The equation $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$ implies that either $g'(x) = 0$ or $g'(x-4) = 0$. Since there are 4 distinct real roots, we can deduce that $g'(x) = 0$ has 2 distinct real roots and $g'(x-4) = 0$ also has 2 distinct real roots.

4. **Determining the roots of $g'(x)$:**

   The roots of $g'(x) = 0$ for $x \leq 0$ are found by solving $3x^2 + 2ax + 15 = 0$. Since the discriminant $\Delta = 4a^2 - 180 > 0$ (for $a \neq 3\sqrt{5}$), there are indeed 2 distinct real roots.

5. **Analyzing the roots of $g'(x-4)$:**

   Since $g'(x-4) = 0$ also has 2 distinct real roots, and considering the continuity and differentiability of $g(x)$ at $x=0$, we can deduce that the roots of $g'(x-4) = 0$ must be $x = 4$ and $x = 4 + \frac{15}{a}$.

6. **Finding the value of $a$:**

   From the roots of $g'(x-4) = 0$, we have $4 + \frac{15}{a} = -2$. Solving this equation for $a$, we get $a = -\frac{15}{6} = -\frac{5}{2}$.

7. **Calculating $g(-2) + g(2)$:**

   With $a = -\frac{5}{2}$, we can find $g(-2)$ by substituting $x = -2$ into $g(x)$ for $x \leq 0$. For $g(2)$, since $g(x) = f(x)$ for $x > 0$ and $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, we can deduce that $g(2) = f(2) = 0$ because the derivative $g'(x)$ changes sign at $x = 2$.

   Therefore, $g(-2) + g(2) = (-2)^3 - \frac{5}{2} \times (-2)^2 + 15 \times (-2) + 7 + 0 = -8 - 10 - 30 + 7 = -41$.

Hence, the value of $g(-2) + g(2)$ is $-41$.

문제 16:
Since $\log_4(3x-5) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3x-5)$,
the original equation can be transformed into $\log_2(x-3) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3x-5)$,
which implies $\log_2(x-3) = \log_2\sqrt{3x-5}$.
Therefore, $x-3 = \sqrt{3x-5}$.
Squaring both sides, we get $x^2 - 6x + 9 = 3x - 5$,
which simplifies to $x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0$.
Solving this, we find $x = 2$ or $x = 7$.
Upon verification, $x = 2$ is not a valid solution,
thus, the solution to the original equation is $x = 7$.

Therefore, the answer is $7$.

문제 17:
To find the value of $f(2)$, we first need to find the expression for $f(x)$. Since we are given $f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x$, we can find $f(x)$ by integrating $f'(x)$ with respect to $x$.

The integral of $9x^2$ with respect to $x$ is $\frac{9}{3}x^3 = 3x^3$.

The integral of $4x$ with respect to $x$ is $\frac{4}{2}x^2 = 2x^2$.

Therefore, $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.

To find the value of $C$, we use the given information that $f(1) = 6$. Substituting $x = 1$ into the expression for $f(x)$, we get:

$f(1) = 3(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + C = 3 + 2 + C = 6$.

Solving for $C$, we find that $C = 1$.

Therefore, the expression for $f(x)$ is $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1$.

To find $f(2)$, we substitute $x = 2$ into the expression for $f(x)$:

$f(2) = 3(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 1 = 3(8) + 2(4) + 1 = 24 + 8 + 1 = 33$.

Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is $33$.

문제 18:
Since for all natural numbers $n$, $$ a_n + a_{n+4} = 12 $$,
it follows that $a_n + a_{n+4} = a_{n+1} + a_{n+5} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+6} = a_{n+3} + a_{n+7} = 12$.
Therefore, $a_1 + a_5 = a_2 + a_6 = a_3 + a_7 = a_4 + a_8 = 12$,
which implies $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 = 48$.
Similarly, $a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{14} + a_{15} + a_{16} = 48$.
Thus, $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n = 96$.
Therefore, the answer is $96$.

**Analysis:** According to the problem, we have $a_n + a_{n+4} = a_{n+1} + a_{n+5} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+6} = a_{n+3} + a_{n+7} = 12$. By grouping and summing, we can find the sum of the first 8 terms, and similarly, the sum of the last 8 terms. Adding these together gives the desired sum.

문제 19:
To find the value of $f(3)$ given that the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{7}{27}$, we first need to find the value of $a$ that satisfies this condition.

Given $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3a x^2 - 12a^2 x$, we find the derivative of $f(x)$ to determine its critical points:

$$f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2$$

To find the critical points, we set $f'(x) = 0$:

$$6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2 = 0$$

Dividing the entire equation by $6$ gives us:

$$x^2 - ax - 2a^2 = 0$$

This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$. To find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-(-a) \pm \sqrt{(-a)^2 - 4(1)(-2a^2)}}{2(1)}$$

Simplifying the expression under the square root:

$$x = \frac{a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 8a^2}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{a \pm \sqrt{9a^2}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{a \pm 3a}{2}$$

This gives us two critical points:

$$x_1 = 2a, \quad x_2 = -a$$

Since $a$ is positive, $x_1 = 2a$ is the point where $f(x)$ achieves its maximum value. Substituting $x = 2a$ into $f(x)$:

$$f(2a) = 2(2a)^3 - 3a(2a)^2 - 12a^2(2a)$$

$$f(2a) = 16a^3 - 12a^3 - 24a^3$$

$$f(2a) = -10a^3$$

Given that the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{7}{27}$, we set $-10a^3 = \frac{7}{27}$ and solve for $a$:

$$-10a^3 = \frac{7}{27}$$

$$a^3 = -\frac{7}{270}$$

$$a = \sqrt[3]{-\frac{7}{270}}$$

Since $a$ is positive, we take the positive cube root:

$$a = \sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{270}}$$

Now that we have the value of $a$, we can find $f(3)$:

$$f(3) = 2(3)^3 - 3a(3)^2 - 12a^2(3)$$

$$f(3) = 54 - 27a - 36a^2$$

Substituting the value of $a$:

$$f(3) = 54 - 27\sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{270}} - 36\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{270}}\right)^2$$

This is the value of $f(3)$ given the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{7}{27}$. However, the exact numerical value is not provided in the solution. If a numerical answer is required, further calculation with the given value of $a$ is needed.

문제 20:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the value of $k$ by setting the equations of the curve and the line equal to each other:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = x
\]

This equation does not have an analytical solution, so we will use the given information that $f(f(x)) = 3x$ for $x > k$ to find the value of $k$.

Let's denote $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ for $x > k$. Then, we have:

\[
f(f(x)) = f\left(\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}-3} = 3x
\]

Since $f(f(x)) = 3x$, we can substitute $x$ with $f(x)$ to get:

\[
f(f(f(x))) = 3f(x)
\]

This implies that $f(x)$ is a solution to the equation $f(f(x)) = 3x$. Therefore, we can set $x = 3$ to find the value of $k$:

\[
f(f(3)) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9
\]

Since $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ for $x > k$, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{f(3)-3} = 9
\]

Taking the logarithm base $\frac{1}{5}$ of both sides, we get:

\[
f(3) - 3 = \log_{\frac{1}{5}} 9
\]

Since $f(3) > k$, we have:

\[
k = 3 + \log_{\frac{1}{5}} 9
\]

Now, we need to find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Since $k > 0$, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} < k
\]

Therefore, we cannot use the given formula for $f(x)$ for $x > k$. However, we can use the property $f(f(x)) = 3x$ to find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$.

Let $t = \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$. Then, we have:

\[
f(t) = f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)
\]

Since $f(f(x)) = 3x$, we have:

\[
f(f(t)) = 3t = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}
\]

Now, we can find the value of $f(t)$ by using the given formula for $f(x)$ for $x > k$:

\[
f(t) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{t-3} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}-3}
\]

Since $f(f(t)) = 3t$, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}-3}-3} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}
\]

Taking the logarithm base $\frac{1}{5}$ of both sides, we get:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}-3}-3 = \log_{\frac{1}{5}} \left(3 \cdot \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)
\]

Solving for $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}-3}$, we get:

\[

문제 21:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the condition given for the function $f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + 4$. The condition states that for all real $\alpha$, the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(2x+1)}{f(x)}$ exists. This implies that $f(x)$ cannot be zero at $x = a$ or $x = 2a + 1$ because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $f(a) = 0$ and $f(2a + 1) \neq 0$
2. $f(a) \neq 0$ and $f(2a + 1) = 0$

Let's analyze each case:

**Case 1: $f(a) = 0$ and $f(2a + 1) \neq 0$**

Given $f(a) = 0$, we substitute $x = a$ into the function $f(x)$:
\[a^3 + a^3 + ab + 4 = 0\]
\[2a^3 + ab + 4 = 0\]

Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, we need to find integer solutions for $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this equation. By trial and error or systematic search, we find that $a = -1$ and $b = 2$ satisfy the equation. However, this case does not meet the condition that $f(2a + 1) \neq 0$ because $f(-1) = 0$ implies $f(2(-1) + 1) = f(-1) = 0$, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, this case is not valid.

**Case 2: $f(a) \neq 0$ and $f(2a + 1) = 0$**

Given $f(2a + 1) = 0$, we substitute $x = 2a + 1$ into the function $f(x)$:
\[(2a + 1)^3 + a(2a + 1)^2 + b(2a + 1) + 4 = 0\]
\[8a^3 + 12a^2 + 6a + 1 + 4a^3 + 4a^2 + a + b(2a + 1) + 4 = 0\]
\[12a^3 + 16a^2 + 7a + b(2a + 1) + 5 = 0\]

Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, we need to find integer solutions for $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this equation. By trial and error or systematic search, we find that $a = -1$ and $b = 1$ satisfy the equation. This case meets the condition that $f(a) \neq 0$ because $f(-1) \neq 0$.

Now, we calculate $f(1)$ using $a = -1$ and $b = 1$:
\[f(1) = 1^3 - 1 \cdot 1^2 + 1 \cdot 1 + 4 = 1 - 1 + 1 + 4 = 5\]

Therefore, the maximum value of $f(1)$ is $5$.

문제 22:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and find all possible values of $|a_1|$.

Condition (a) tells us that for any natural number $n$, the next term $a_{n+1}$ is determined by the current term $a_n$ as follows:
- If $|a_n|$ is odd, then $a_{n+1} = a_n - 3$.
- If $a_n = 0$ or $|a_n|$ is even, then $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} a_n$.

Condition (b) states that the smallest natural number $m$ such that $|a_m| = |a_{m+2}|$ is 3. This means that the sequence repeats every 3 terms in terms of absolute values.

Let's analyze the sequence starting from $a_1$ and see how it behaves:

1. If $|a_1|$ is odd, then $a_2 = a_1 - 3$ and $a_3 = a_2 - 3 = a_1 - 6$. Since $|a_1| = |a_4|$, we have $|a_1| = |a_1 - 6|$. This implies that $a_1 = 3$ or $a_1 = -3$.

2. If $|a_1|$ is even, then $a_2 = \frac{1}{2} a_1$ and $a_3 = \frac{1}{2} a_2 = \frac{1}{4} a_1$. Since $|a_1| = |a_4|$, we have $|a_1| = |\frac{1}{4} a_1|$. This implies that $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = \pm 4$.

Now, let's check if these values of $a_1$ satisfy the given conditions:

- For $a_1 = 3$, we get $a_2 = 0$ and $a_3 = 0$. This sequence does not satisfy condition (b) because $|a_1| \neq |a_3|$.
- For $a_1 = -3$, we get $a_2 = -6$ and $a_3 = -9$. This sequence does not satisfy condition (b) because $|a_1| \neq |a_3|$.
- For $a_1 = 0$, we get $a_2 = 0$ and $a_3 = 0$. This sequence satisfies condition (b) because $|a_1| = |a_3|$.
- For $a_1 = 4$, we get $a_2 = 2$ and $a_3 = 1$. This sequence does not satisfy condition (b) because $|a_1| \neq |a_3|$.
- For $a_1 = -4$, we get $a_2 = -2$ and $a_3 = -1$. This sequence does not satisfy condition (b) because $|a_1| \neq |a_3|$.

Therefore, the only possible value of $|a_1|$ that satisfies both conditions is $|a_1| = 0$.

The sum of all possible values of $|a_1|$ is $0$.

문제 23:
To find the value of $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$, we can use the following approach:

First, we know that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$. This is a well-known limit that can be proven using the squeeze theorem or L'Hopital's rule.

Now, let's rewrite the given limit using this fact:

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \left(3 \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x} \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x}\right)
\]

Since $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$, it follows that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} = 1$ as well. Therefore, we can substitute this limit into our expression:

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \left(3 \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x} \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x}\right) = 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 3
\]

Thus, the value of $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$ is $3$.

문제 24:
To find the value of the integral $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx$, we first simplify the integrand:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \frac{x+1+1}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \left(1 + \frac{1}{x+1}\right) dx$$

Now, we can split the integral into two parts:

$$\int_0^{10} 1 dx + \int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx$$

The first integral is simply the area of a rectangle with height 1 and width 10, so:

$$\int_0^{10} 1 dx = 10$$

For the second integral, we find the antiderivative of $\frac{1}{x+1}$, which is $\ln|x+1|$. Then we evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of integration:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx = \ln|x+1| \bigg|_0^{10} = \ln(11) - \ln(1) = \ln(11)$$

Since $\ln(1) = 0$, we have:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx = \ln(11)$$

Adding the two parts together, we get:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = 10 + \ln(11)$$

Therefore, the value of the integral is $10 + \ln(11)$.

문제 25:
Since $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}=1$,

it follows that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_n}{n}=1$.

Therefore, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$

$=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n\right)}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}$

$=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}$

$=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{a_n^2}{n^2}+1}+\frac{a_n}{n}}$

$=\frac{1}{2}$.

Hence, the answer is $\frac{1}{2}$.

This problem tests the understanding of the limit of a sequence and the application of the limit operation rules. It is a basic problem.

문제 26:
To find the volume of the solid, we first need to determine the height of the square cross-section at any given $x$. Since the cross-section is a square, its height is equal to its side length. Given that the base of the solid is the region enclosed by the curve $y=\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}$, the $x$-axis, and the lines $x=1, x=e$, the height of the square cross-section at $x$ is equal to the value of $y$ at that $x$.

Therefore, the height of the square cross-section at $x$ is $y=\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}$.

The volume of the solid can be found by integrating the area of the square cross-section from $x=1$ to $x=e$. The area of the square cross-section is the square of its side length, which is $y^2$. Thus, the volume $V$ is given by:

\[V = \int_{1}^{e} y^2 dx = \int_{1}^{e} \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} dx\]

To evaluate this integral, we can use the substitution method or other integration techniques. However, the problem does not require us to find the exact value of the integral. Instead, we are asked to find the volume of the solid, which is the definite integral from $1$ to $e$.

Therefore, the volume of the solid is:

\[V = \int_{1}^{e} \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} dx\]

Without the need to find the antiderivative and evaluate it at the limits, we conclude that the volume of the solid is given by the definite integral above. If a numerical value is required, we would need to evaluate the integral using numerical methods or a calculator. However, based on the given information and the problem statement, the volume of the solid is expressed as:

\[V = \int_{1}^{e} \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} dx\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[V = \int_{1}^{e} \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} dx\]

문제 27:
Since the tangent to the curve $y=g(x)$ at the point $(0, g(0))$ is the $x$-axis, we have $g'(0) = 0$.

Given $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x$, we find $g'(x) = f'(e^x) \cdot e^x + e^x$.

Therefore, $g'(0) = f'(1) + 1 = 0$, which implies $f'(1) = -1$.

Since $f(x)$ is a cubic function with leading coefficient 1, we can express it as $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$.

Thus, $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b$.

Substituting $x = 1$ into $f'(x)$, we get $f'(1) = 3 + 2a + b = -1$.

Since $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x = e^{3x} + ae^{2x} + be^x + c + e^x$,

we have $g'(x) = 3e^{3x} + 2ae^{2x} + (b + 1)e^x$.

Given $g(0) = 1 + a + b + c = 0$, we find $c = -1 - a - b$.

Therefore, $g(x) = e^{3x} + ae^{2x} + be^x - 1 - a - b$.

Since $g(x)$ has an inverse function $h(x)$, we have $h(g(x)) = x$.

Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$, we get $h'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = 1$.

Thus, $h'(g(x)) = \frac{1}{g'(x)}$.

Since $g(0) = -1 - a - b$, we have $h'(-1 - a - b) = \frac{1}{g'(0)} = \frac{1}{3 + 2a + b + 1} = \frac{1}{-1 + 1} = \frac{1}{0}$.

However, this result does not make sense, as the derivative of a function at a point cannot be undefined. It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's correct it.

Given $g'(0) = 3 + 2a + b + 1 = 0$, we have $3 + 2a + b = -1$.

Therefore, $h'(-1 - a - b) = \frac{1}{g'(0)} = \frac{1}{3 + 2a + b + 1} = \frac{1}{-1 + 1} = \frac{1}{0}$, which is still incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We are given that $g'(0) = 0$, which implies $f'(1) + 1 = 0$. Since $f'(1) = 3 + 2a + b$, we have $3 + 2a + b + 1 = 0$, which simplifies to $3 + 2a + b = -1$.

Now, we need to find $h'(8)$. Since $h(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$, we have $h'(g(x)) = \frac{1}{g'(x)}$. To find $h'(8)$, we need to find the value of $x$ such that $g(x) = 8$ and then evaluate $h'(g(x))$ at that point.

However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact values of $a$ and $b$, which are necessary to find $g(x)$ and subsequently $h'(8)$. Therefore, with the given information, we cannot determine the value of $h'(8)$.

The correct approach to find $h'(8)$ would involve solving for $a$ and $b$ using additional information or constraints, and then finding the value of $x$ such that $g(x) = 8$. Once we have that value of $x$, we can evaluate $h'(g(x))$ to find $h'(8)$. However, without additional information, we cannot proceed further.

Therefore, the answer is: $\text{Cannot be determined with the given information}$.

문제 28:
Since $f'(x) = -x + e^{1-x^2}$, we have $f'(1) = -1 + e^{1-1^2} = e - 1$.

The equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $(1, f(1))$ is $y - f(1) = (e-1)(x-1)$, which simplifies to $y = (e-1)x + f(1) - e + 1$.

The intersection point of the tangent line and the $y$-axis is $(0, f(1) - e + 1)$.

Therefore, $g(t) = \int_{0}^{t} [f(x) - (e-1)x - f(1) + e - 1] dx$.

Thus, $g'(t) = f(t) - (e-1)t - f(1) + e - 1$.

So, $g(1) + g'(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [f(x) - (e-1)x - f(1) + e - 1] dx + f(1) - (e-1) - f(1) + e - 1 = \int_{0}^{1} [f(x) - (e-1)x] dx - 1$.

Since $f'(x) = -x + e^{1-x^2}$, we have $f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{2}e^{1-x^2} + C$.

Therefore, $g(1) + g'(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [-\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{2}e^{1-x^2} + C - (e-1)x] dx - 1 = -\frac{1}{6}x^3 - \frac{1}{2}e^{1-x^2} - \frac{1}{2}(e-1)x^2 + Cx \bigg|_{0}^{1} - 1 = -\frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{2}e + \frac{1}{2}e - \frac{1}{2} + C - 1 = C - \frac{7}{6}$.

Hence, the answer is $C - \frac{7}{6}$.

This problem tests the application of derivatives and definite integrals, as well as the ability to transform and calculate. It is a moderately difficult problem.

문제 29:
**Answer**

$10$**Solution**

Let $S_1=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(|a_n|+a_n)$ and $S_2=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(|a_n|-a_n)$. Since $S_1+S_2=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n|$ and $S_1-S_2=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$, we have $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n|=\frac{30}{3}$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n=\frac{10}{3}$. Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^na_n=\frac{1}{2}(S_1-S_2)=\frac{10}{3}$. Let $b_n=(-1)^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}a_n$, then $b_{2n-1}=(-1)^na_n$ and $b_{2n}=(-1)^{n+1}a_n$. Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_n=\frac{1}{2}(S_1-S_2)=\frac{10}{3}$. Let $T_n=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}b_{m+k}$, then $T_n=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}b_{m+k}=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}b_k-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k+\sum_{k=2n+1}^{m+2n}b_k$. Since $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}T_n>\frac{1}{700}$, we have $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=2n+1}^{m+2n}b_k>\frac{1}{700}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k$. Let $m=2p-1$, then $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=2n+1}^{m+2n}b_k=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=2n+1}^{2p+2n-1}b_k=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=2n+1}^{2p+2n-1}(-1)^kb_k=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{2p-1}(-1)^{k+2n}b_{k+2n}$. Since $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}b_{k+2n}=0$, we have $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{2p-1}(-1)^{k+2n}b_{k+2n}=0$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{700}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k<0$, which implies $\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k>\frac{1}{700}$. Since $\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k\leq\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_k=\frac{10}{3}$, we have $m-1\leq 2100$. Also, since $\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k\geq b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4=\frac{10}{3}$, we have $m-1\geq 4$. Therefore, $4\leq m-1\leq 2100$, which implies $5\leq m\leq 2101$. When $m$ is even, $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=2n+1}^{m+2n}b_k=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=2n+1}^{m+2n}(-1)^kb_k=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{m}(-1)^{k+2n}b_{k+2n}=0$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{700}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k<0$, which implies $\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k>\frac{1}{700}$. Since $\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k\leq\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_k=\frac{10}{3}$, we have $m-1\leq 210

문제 30:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the derivative of $f(x)$:

$$f'(x) = a\cos(ax + b + \sin x) + \cos(ax + b + \sin x)\cos x$$

Given that $f'(0) = f'(4\pi)$, we have:

$$a + \cos b = a\cos(4\pi a + b) + \cos(4\pi a + b)$$

Since $1 \leq a \leq 2$, we can deduce that $\cos b = \cos(4\pi a + b)$. This implies that $b = 4\pi a + b + 2k\pi$ for some integer $k$. Solving for $a$, we get $a = -\frac{k}{2\pi}$. However, since $1 \leq a \leq 2$, the only possible value for $k$ is $-2\pi$, which gives us $a = 1$.

Now, let's find the values of $b$ that satisfy the given conditions. Since $f(0) = 0$ and $f(2\pi) = 2\pi + b$, we have:

$$\sin b = 0$$
$$\sin(2\pi + b + \sin 2\pi) = 2\pi + b$$

This simplifies to:

$$\sin b = 0$$
$$\sin(b) = 2\pi + b$$

Solving these equations, we find that $b = -2\pi$. Therefore, the function $f(x)$ becomes:

$$f(x) = \sin(x - 2\pi + \sin x) = \sin(x + \sin x)$$

To find the local maxima of $f(x)$, we need to solve $f'(x) = 0$:

$$f'(x) = \cos(x + \sin x)(1 + \cos x) = 0$$

This gives us two cases:

1. $\cos(x + \sin x) = 0$
2. $1 + \cos x = 0$

Solving these equations, we find that the local maxima occur at $x = 2k\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $x = 2k\pi + \pi$ for some integer $k$. Since we are looking for the smallest positive $\alpha$ where $f(x)$ has a local maximum, we have $\alpha_1 = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Now, let's find the number of elements in $A$. Since $A$ consists of all values of $\alpha$ in the open interval $(0, 4\pi)$ where $f(x)$ has a local maximum, we have:

$$n = \left\lfloor \frac{4\pi}{\frac{\pi}{2}} \right\rfloor = 8$$

Finally, we calculate $n\alpha_1 - ab$:

$$n\alpha_1 - ab = 8 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} - 1 \cdot (-2\pi) = 8\pi$$

Therefore, $p = 1$ and $q = 8$, and the value of $p + q$ is $1 + 8 = 9$.
