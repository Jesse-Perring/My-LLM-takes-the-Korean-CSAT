문제 1:
To solve the problem, we start by expressing both terms under the same exponent:

$$\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

We know that $25$ is $5^2$, so we can rewrite $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ as $(5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Using the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^{m})^{n} = a^{mn}$, we get:

$$(5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5^{2 \times \frac{1}{3}} = 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$$

Now, we can combine the terms since they have the same base:

$$\sqrt[3]{5} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$$

Using the rule for multiplying powers with the same base, which states that $a^{m} \times a^{n} = a^{m+n}$, we add the exponents:

$$5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}} = 5^{1}$$

Therefore, the value of $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is:

$$5$$

문제 2:
To find the value of $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$, we recognize this as the definition of the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=2$. That is,

$$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h} = f'(2).$$

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 8x + 7$, we find the derivative $f'(x)$:

$$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^3) - \frac{d}{dx}(8x) + \frac{d}{dx}(7) = 3x^2 - 8.$$

Now, we evaluate $f'(2)$:

$$f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 8 = 3 \cdot 4 - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4.$$

Therefore, the value of $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$ is $4$.

문제 3:
Given that the geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ has both the first term and common ratio equal to a positive number $k$, we can express the terms of the sequence as $a_n = k^n$.

Given the equation $$\frac{a_4}{a_2}+\frac{a_2}{a_1}=30$$, we substitute the expressions for $a_4$, $a_2$, and $a_1$ in terms of $k$:

$$\frac{k^4}{k^2} + \frac{k^2}{k} = 30$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$k^2 + k = 30$$

Rearranging the equation to set it to zero, we have:

$$k^2 + k - 30 = 0$$

Factoring the quadratic equation, we find:

$$(k + 6)(k - 5) = 0$$

Since $k$ is a positive number, we discard the negative solution and take $k = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $k$ is $5$.

문제 4:
Since $f(x)$ is continuous for all real numbers,

Therefore, $$\begin{cases} \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) \\ \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = f(-2)\end{cases}$$,

Thus, $$\begin{cases} 5 \times (-2) + a = (-2)^2 - a \\ 5 \times (-2) + a = (-2)^2 - a\end{cases}$$,

Solving this, we get $a = 6$.

Therefore, the answer is $6$.

**Analysis:** According to the problem, $f(x)$ is continuous for all real numbers, which means $$\begin{cases} \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) \\ \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = f(-2)\end{cases}$$. By substituting the piecewise function, we can find the value of $a$.

문제 5:
Solution: Since $f(x)=(x^2+1)(3x^2-x)$,
we have $f'(x)=(x^2+1)'(3x^2-x)+(x^2+1)(3x^2-x)'=2x(3x^2-x)+(x^2+1)(6x-1)$,
thus $f'(1)=2\times1\times(3\times1^2-1)+(1^2+1)(6\times1-1)=2\times2+2\times5=14$.
Therefore, the answer is $14$.

**Analysis:** To find the derivative of the function, we use the product rule for differentiation. Then, we substitute $x=1$ into the derivative to find the value of $f'(1)$.

문제 6:
Given that $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta\right)=-\frac{1}{5}$, we can use the trigonometric identity $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta\right) = -\sin \theta$ to find the value of $\sin \theta$. Therefore, we have:

\[
-\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{5} \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$. We know that $1-\cos^2 \theta = \sin^2 \theta$ by the Pythagorean identity. Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}
\]

Substituting the value of $\sin \theta$ we found earlier:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{5}} = 5
\]

Therefore, the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$ is $5$.

문제 7:
To find the value of $f(1)$, we first need to find the expression for $f(x)$. Since we are given the integral of $f(x)$ from $0$ to $x$, we can find $f(x)$ by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to $x$.

Given:
$$ \int_0^x f(t) dt = 3x^3 + 2x $$

Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt$, then $F'(x) = f(x)$. Therefore, differentiating the left side gives us $f(x)$, and differentiating the right side gives us the derivative of $3x^3 + 2x$.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x f(t) dt \right) = \frac{d}{dx} (3x^3 + 2x) $$

$$ f(x) = 9x^2 + 2 $$

Now that we have the expression for $f(x)$, we can find $f(1)$ by substituting $x = 1$ into the expression.

$$ f(1) = 9(1)^2 + 2 $$

$$ f(1) = 9 + 2 $$

$$ f(1) = 11 $$

Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $11$.

문제 8:
Solution: Since $a=2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}+\log_2 20 = 2 \times (-1) + \frac{\log 20}{\log 2} = -2 + \frac{\log 2 + \log 10}{\log 2} = -2 + \frac{\log 2 + 1}{\log 2}$,

Therefore, $a \times b = (-2 + \frac{\log 2 + 1}{\log 2}) \times \log 2 = -2 \log 2 + \log 2 + 1 = 1 - \log 2$.

Hence, the answer is $1 - \log 2$.

By using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify $a$ and then calculate the value of $a \times b$.

This problem tests the understanding of logarithmic properties and computational skills. It is a basic question.

문제 9:
Solution: Since $f(x)=3x^2-16x-20$,
then $F(x)=x^3-8x^2-20x$,
thus $\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx = F(a) - F(-2) = a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a + 24$,
and $\int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx = F(0) - F(-2) = 24$,
therefore, $a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a = 0$,
solving this gives $a = 10$, $a = 0$, or $a = -2$ (discard this solution),
since $a > 0$,
thus $a = 10$.
Hence, the answer is $10$.

**Analysis:** By finding the antiderivative of the function, we can transform the definite integral into a function of $a$, and then solve for the value of $a$.

문제 10:
Given the function $f(x)=a \cos bx + 3$ defined on the closed interval $[0,2\pi]$, and knowing that $f(x)$ has a maximum value of 13 at $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$, we can start by setting up the equation based on the given information:

1. The maximum value of $f(x)$ is 13 at $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$, so we have:
\[a \cos\left(b \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 3 = 13\]

2. Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[a \cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = 10\]

3. Since $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers, and the cosine function has a range of $[-1, 1]$, the only way for $a \cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right)$ to equal 10 is if $a=10$ and $\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = 1$.

4. For $\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right) = 1$, the angle $\frac{b\pi}{3}$ must be a multiple of $2\pi$, which means $b$ must be a multiple of 6.

5. The smallest natural number $b$ that satisfies this condition is $b=6$.

6. Therefore, the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ that satisfies the given conditions is $(10, 6)$.

7. The minimum value of $a+b$ for this pair is:
\[a + b = 10 + 6 = 16\]

Hence, the minimum value of $a+b$ for the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ is $16$.

문제 11:
Solution: Given $x = t^3 - \frac{3}{2} t^2 - 6t$,

Therefore, $x' = 3t^2 - 3t - 6$,

Let $x' = 0$, solving this gives $t = 2$ or $t = -1$ (discard this solution),

Therefore, $x'' = 6t - 3$,

Thus, the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes after departure is $6 \times 2 - 3 = 9$.

Hence, the answer is $9$.

This problem examines the application of derivatives in physics, where the derivative of displacement with respect to time is velocity, and the derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. It is a basic question.

문제 12:
Since the sequence $\{b_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with $b_1=2$ and $b_{k+1} = 2 + kd$,

we have $\frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{a_k}{2 + kd}$.

Given that $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$,

we can derive that $\frac{a_1}{2 + d} + \frac{a_2}{2 + 2d} + \ldots + \frac{a_n}{2 + nd} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$.

When $n=1$, we have $\frac{a_1}{2 + d} = \frac{1}{2}$, which implies $a_1 = 2 + d$.

Since $a_1 = 2$, we have $d = 0$.

Therefore, $b_{k+1} = 2$ for all $k$.

Thus, $\frac{a_1}{2} + \frac{a_2}{2} + \ldots + \frac{a_n}{2} = \frac{1}{2} n^2$, which simplifies to $a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = n^2$.

Therefore, $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = 5^2 = 25$.

Hence, the answer is $25$.

This problem tests the understanding of arithmetic sequences and the application of the method of differences. It is a moderately difficult problem.

문제 13:
Given the cubic function $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ with leading coefficient 1, and the conditions $f(1) = f(2) = 0$ and $f'(0) = -7$, we aim to find the value of $B - A$, where $A$ is the area enclosed by the curve $y = f(x)$, the y-axis, and the segment $OQ$, and $B$ is the area enclosed by the curve $y = f(x)$ and the segment $PQ$.

First, we find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ using the given conditions:

1. From $f(1) = 0$, we have $1 + a + b + c = 0$.
2. From $f(2) = 0$, we have $8 + 4a + 2b + c = 0$.
3. From $f'(0) = -7$, we have $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b$, so $f'(0) = b = -7$.

Solving these equations, we find:
- Substituting $b = -7$ into the first two equations, we get $a + c = 8$ and $4a + c = 15$.
- Solving this system, we find $a = 1$ and $c = 7$.

Thus, the cubic function is $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 7x + 7$.

Next, we find the coordinates of point $Q$. Since $Q$ lies on the segment $OP$ and $P(3, f(3))$, we have $Q(3t, 3tf(3))$ for some $t \in (0, 1)$.

The area $A$ is given by the integral $\int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx$, and the area $B$ is given by the integral $\int_{3t}^{3} f(x) dx$.

To find $B - A$, we calculate the definite integral $\int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx$ and then subtract $2A$ from it:

\[
\int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx = \left[ \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{7}{2}x^2 + 7x \right]_{0}^{3} = \frac{81}{4} + 9 - \frac{63}{2} + 21 = \frac{81}{4}
\]

Since $B - A = \int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx - 2A$, and $A = \int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx$, we have:

\[
B - A = \frac{81}{4} - 2 \int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx
\]

Given that $B - A = 18$, we solve for $t$:

\[
18 = \frac{81}{4} - 2 \int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx
\]

\[
\int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx = \frac{81}{8} - 9
\]

\[
\int_{0}^{3t} f(x) dx = \frac{9}{8}
\]

Solving for $t$, we find $t = \frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the value of $B - A$ is $18$.

문제 14:
To solve this problem, we follow a series of steps based on the given information and the properties of triangles and circles.

1. **Understanding the Given Ratio**: Given $\sin A: \sin C=8:5$, we can use the Law of Sines to find the ratio of the sides opposite these angles in triangle ABC. Since $\frac{\sin A}{\sin C} = \frac{8}{5}$, it follows that $\frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{8}{5}$. This is because the Law of Sines states that $\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$ for any triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ opposite angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

2. **Finding the Ratio of Areas**: The ratio of the areas of triangles ADE and ABC is given as $9:35$. The area of a triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. Since triangles ADE and ABC share the same height (the perpendicular distance from A to BC), the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases, which are AD and AB, respectively. Therefore, $\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{9}{35}$.

3. **Determining the Ratio of AD to DB**: Given that $\overline{AD}:\overline{DB}=3:2$, we can express this as $\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{3}{2}$. Combining this with the ratio $\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{9}{35}$, we find that $\frac{DB}{AB} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{35} = \frac{6}{35}$. Since $\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{9}{35}$, it follows that $\frac{DB}{AB} = \frac{35}{35} - \frac{9}{35} = \frac{26}{35}$.

4. **Calculating the Length of AB**: Knowing that $\frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{8}{5}$ and the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is 7, we can find the length of AB. Since BC is the diameter of the circumcircle, $BC = 2 \times 7 = 14$. Therefore, $AB = \frac{5}{8} \times BC = \frac{5}{8} \times 14 = \frac{35}{4}$.

5. **Finding the Length of AD and DB**: With $AB = \frac{35}{4}$, we can find $AD = \frac{9}{35} \times \frac{35}{4} = \frac{9}{4}$ and $DB = \frac{26}{35} \times \frac{35}{4} = \frac{13}{2}$.

6. **Determining the Length of AE**: Since AE is a radius of circle O, $AE = AD + DB = \frac{9}{4} + \frac{13}{2} = \frac{37}{4}$.

7. **Calculating the Area of Triangle ADE**: The area of triangle ADE is $\frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DE = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{9}{4} \times \frac{37}{4} = \frac{333}{32}$.

8. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABC**: The area of triangle ABC is $\frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BC = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{35}{4} \times 14 = \frac{245}{4}$.

9. **Determining the Ratio of the Areas of Triangles ADE and ABC**: The ratio of the areas of triangles ADE and ABC is $\frac{333}{32} : \frac{245}{4} = 9 : 35$.

10. **Calculating the Maximum Area of Triangle PBC**: The maximum area of triangle PBC occurs when P is at the point where circle O intersects BC, which is E. The area of triangle PBC (or triangle EBC) is the area of triangle ABC minus the area of triangle ADE, which is $\frac{245}{4} - \frac{333}{32} = \frac{1805}{32}$.

Therefore, the maximum area of triangle PBC for a point P on circle O is $\frac{1805}{32}$.

문제 15:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and find the value of $g(-2) + g(2)$. Let's break down the solution step by step.

1. **Understanding the conditions for $g(x)$:**

   Given that $g(x)$ is differentiable for all real numbers, we know that the derivative $g'(x)$ must exist and be continuous at all points. This implies that the piecewise function $g(x)$ must be continuous and smooth at $x=0$.

2. **Analyzing the derivative $g'(x)$:**

   For $x \leq 0$, the derivative of $g(x)$ is $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + 15$. For $x > 0$, since $g(x) = f(x)$ and $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, the derivative $g'(x) = f'(x)$ will be a linear function with a negative slope.

3. **Finding the roots of $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$:**

   The equation $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$ implies that either $g'(x) = 0$ or $g'(x-4) = 0$. Since there are 4 distinct real roots, we can deduce that $g'(x) = 0$ has 2 distinct real roots and $g'(x-4) = 0$ also has 2 distinct real roots.

4. **Determining the roots of $g'(x)$:**

   The roots of $g'(x) = 0$ for $x \leq 0$ are found by solving $3x^2 + 2ax + 15 = 0$. Since the discriminant $\Delta = 4a^2 - 180 > 0$ (because $a \neq 3\sqrt{5}$), there are indeed 2 distinct real roots.

5. **Analyzing the roots of $g'(x-4)$:**

   Since $g'(x-4) = 0$ also has 2 distinct real roots, and considering the behavior of $g'(x)$ for $x > 0$, we can deduce that the roots of $g'(x-4) = 0$ correspond to the roots of $f'(x) = 0$ shifted 4 units to the right.

6. **Finding the value of $a$:**

   Given that $g'(0) = 15$ and $g'(-4) = 0$, we can set up the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   15 = 3 \times 0^2 + 2a \times 0 + 15 \\
   0 = 3 \times (-4)^2 + 2a \times (-4) + 15
   \end{cases}
   \]
   Solving this system, we find that $a = -3$.

7. **Calculating $g(-2) + g(2)$:**

   With $a = -3$, we have $g(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 15x + 7$ for $x \leq 0$. Therefore, $g(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 + 15(-2) + 7 = -27$.

   For $x > 0$, since $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient and $g(x)$ is continuous and differentiable at $x=0$, we can deduce that $f(x)$ must have a vertex at $(2, 17)$ to satisfy the given conditions. Thus, $g(2) = f(2) = 17$.

   Therefore, $g(-2) + g(2) = -27 + 17 = -10$.

Hence, the value of $g(-2) + g(2)$ is $-10$.

문제 16:
Since $\log_4(3x-5) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3x-5)$,
the original equation can be transformed into $\log_2(x-3) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3x-5)$,
which implies $\log_2(x-3) = \log_2\sqrt{3x-5}$,
thus $x-3 = \sqrt{3x-5}$,
squaring both sides gives $x^2 - 6x + 9 = 3x - 5$,
rearranging yields $x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0$,
factoring gives $(x-2)(x-7) = 0$,
solving for $x$ gives $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = 7$,
since $x-3 > 0$,
we have $x > 3$,
therefore, $x = 7$.
Hence, the answer is $7$.

문제 17:
To find the value of $f(2)$, we first need to find the expression for $f(x)$. Since we are given $f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x$, we can find $f(x)$ by integrating $f'(x)$ with respect to $x$.

The integral of $9x^2$ with respect to $x$ is $\frac{9}{3}x^3 = 3x^3$.

The integral of $4x$ with respect to $x$ is $\frac{4}{2}x^2 = 2x^2$.

Therefore, $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.

To find the value of $C$, we use the given information that $f(1) = 6$. Substituting $x = 1$ into the expression for $f(x)$, we get:

$f(1) = 3(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + C = 3 + 2 + C = 6$.

Solving for $C$, we find that $C = 1$.

Therefore, the expression for $f(x)$ is $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1$.

To find $f(2)$, we substitute $x = 2$ into the expression for $f(x)$:

$f(2) = 3(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 1 = 3(8) + 2(4) + 1 = 24 + 8 + 1 = 33$.

Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is $33$.

문제 18:
Since for all natural numbers $n$, $$ a_n + a_{n+4} = 12 $$,
it follows that $a_n + a_{n+4} = a_{n+1} + a_{n+5} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+6} = a_{n+3} + a_{n+7} = 12$.
Therefore, $a_1 + a_5 = a_2 + a_6 = a_3 + a_7 = a_4 + a_8 = 12$,
which implies $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 = 48$.
Similarly, $a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{14} + a_{15} + a_{16} = 48$.
Thus, $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n = 96$.
Therefore, the answer is $96$.

**Analysis:** According to the problem, we have $a_n + a_{n+4} = a_{n+1} + a_{n+5} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+6} = a_{n+3} + a_{n+7} = 12$. By grouping and summing, we can find the sum of the first 8 terms, and similarly, the sum of the last 8 terms. Adding these together gives the desired sum.

문제 19:
To find the value of $f(3)$ given that the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{7}{27}$, we first need to find the value of $a$ that satisfies this condition.

Given $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3a x^2 - 12a^2 x$, we find the derivative of $f(x)$ to determine its critical points:

$$f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2$$

To find the critical points, we set $f'(x) = 0$:

$$6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2 = 0$$

Dividing the entire equation by $6$ gives us:

$$x^2 - ax - 2a^2 = 0$$

This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$. To find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-(-a) \pm \sqrt{(-a)^2 - 4(1)(-2a^2)}}{2(1)}$$

Simplifying the expression under the square root:

$$x = \frac{a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 8a^2}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{a \pm \sqrt{9a^2}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{a \pm 3a}{2}$$

This gives us two critical points:

$$x_1 = 2a, \quad x_2 = -a$$

Since $a$ is positive, $x_1 = 2a$ is the point where $f(x)$ achieves its maximum value. Substituting $x = 2a$ into $f(x)$:

$$f(2a) = 2(2a)^3 - 3a(2a)^2 - 12a^2(2a)$$

$$f(2a) = 16a^3 - 12a^3 - 24a^3$$

$$f(2a) = -10a^3$$

Given that the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{7}{27}$, we set $-10a^3 = \frac{7}{27}$ and solve for $a$:

$$-10a^3 = \frac{7}{27}$$

$$a^3 = -\frac{7}{270}$$

$$a = \sqrt[3]{-\frac{7}{270}}$$

Since $a$ is positive, we take the positive cube root:

$$a = \sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{270}}$$

Now that we have the value of $a$, we can find $f(3)$:

$$f(3) = 2(3)^3 - 3a(3)^2 - 12a^2(3)$$

$$f(3) = 54 - 27a - 36a^2$$

Substituting the value of $a$:

$$f(3) = 54 - 27\sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{270}} - 36\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{270}}\right)^2$$

This is the value of $f(3)$ given the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{7}{27}$. However, the exact numerical value is not provided in the solution. If a numerical answer is required, further calculation with the exact value of $a$ is needed.

문제 20:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the value of $k$ by setting the equations of the curve and the line equal to each other:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = x
\]

Since $k$ is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{k-3} = k
\]

Now, let's define a function $g(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} - x$. We want to find the root of this function, which is $k$. Notice that $g(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on the interval $(0, +\infty)$ because the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$ is negative for all $x > 0$.

Since $g(2) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{-1} - 2 = \frac{5}{5} - 2 = -1 < 0$ and $g(3) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{0} - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2 < 0$, we know that $k$ must be between $2$ and $3$.

Next, we are given that for all $x > k$, $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ and $f(f(x)) = 3x$. Let's define another function $h(x) = f(f(x)) - 3x$. We want to find the root of this function, which is also $k$.

Since $h(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on the interval $(k, +\infty)$ and $h(k) = f(f(k)) - 3k = f(k) - 3k = k - 3k = -2k < 0$, we know that $k$ must be between $2$ and $3$.

Now, let's find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Since $k$ is between $2$ and $3$, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} < \frac{1}{2^3 \times 5^6} = \frac{1}{8 \times 15625} = \frac{1}{125000} < k
\]

Therefore, we can use the definition of $f(x)$ for $x > k$:

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} - 3}
\]

Now, let's find the value of $f(f(k))$:

\[
f(f(k)) = f(k) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{k-3} = k
\]

Since $f(f(x)) = 3x$, we have:

\[
3k = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{k-3}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

\[
\ln(3k) = (k-3)\ln\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = (3-k)\ln(5)
\]

Now, let's find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$:

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} - 3} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} - \frac{\ln(3k)}{\ln(5)}}
\]

Since $\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} < k$ and $\frac{\ln(3k)}{\ln(5)} > 0$, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} - \frac{\ln(3k)}{\ln(5)} < k - \frac{\ln(3k)}{\ln(5)} = 0
\]

Therefore, $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) > 1$. Since $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing for $x > k$, and $f(k) = k < 3$, we have:

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) < f(k) = k
\]

Thus, the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$ is between $1$ and $k$. Since $k$ is between $2$ and $3$, the only integer value that satisfies this condition is $2$.

Therefore, the answer is $2$.

문제 21:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the condition given for the function $f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + 4$. The condition states that for all real $\alpha$, the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(2x+1)}{f(x)}$ exists. This implies that $f(x)$ cannot be zero at $x = a$ or $x = 2a + 1$ because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, we have two equations:

1. $f(a) = a^3 + a^2 a + b a + 4 \neq 0$
2. $f(2a + 1) = (2a + 1)^3 + a (2a + 1)^2 + b (2a + 1) + 4 \neq 0$

Since $f(x)$ is a cubic function, it can have at most three real roots. However, the condition given implies that $f(x)$ has no real roots at $x = a$ or $x = 2a + 1$. Therefore, $f(x)$ must have at most one real root.

Now, let's find the value of $f(1)$. We have:

$f(1) = 1^3 + a \cdot 1^2 + b \cdot 1 + 4 = a + b + 5$

Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $f(1)$ is also an integer. To maximize $f(1)$, we need to maximize $a + b$. However, we also need to ensure that $f(x)$ has at most one real root.

Let's consider the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b$. For $f(x)$ to have at most one real root, $f'(x)$ must not have any real roots. This means the discriminant of $f'(x)$, $\Delta = 4a^2 - 12b$, must be less than or equal to zero. Therefore, we have:

$4a^2 - 12b \leq 0$

Simplifying this inequality, we get:

$b \geq \frac{1}{3}a^2$

Now, we want to maximize $a + b$ subject to the constraint $b \geq \frac{1}{3}a^2$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, we can find the maximum value of $a + b$ by testing integer values of $a$ and finding the corresponding $b$ that satisfies the inequality.

After testing integer values of $a$, we find that the maximum value of $a + b$ occurs when $a = 0$ and $b = 0$. Therefore, the maximum value of $f(1)$ is:

$f(1) = a + b + 5 = 0 + 0 + 5 = 5$

So, the maximum value of $f(1)$ is $5$.

문제 22:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and find all possible values of $|a_1|$.

Condition (a) tells us that for any natural number $n$, the next term $a_{n+1}$ is determined by the following rules:
1. If $|a_n|$ is odd, then $a_{n+1} = a_n - 3$.
2. If $a_n = 0$ or $|a_n|$ is even, then $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}a_n$.

Condition (b) states that the smallest natural number $m$ such that $|a_m| = |a_{m+2}|$ is 3. This means that the sequence repeats every 3 terms in terms of absolute values.

Let's analyze the sequence based on the given conditions:

1. Since $|a_3| = |a_5|$, it implies that $|a_3| = |a_2 - 3|$ (from condition (a) when $|a_2|$ is odd) or $|a_3| = \frac{1}{2}|a_2|$ (from condition (a) when $|a_2|$ is even).

2. If $|a_3| = |a_2 - 3|$, then $|a_2|$ must be odd, and $|a_3| = |a_2| - 3$. Since $|a_3| = |a_5|$, it follows that $|a_5| = |a_2| - 3$. However, this would imply that $|a_2| = |a_5| + 3$, which contradicts the given condition that the sequence repeats every 3 terms in terms of absolute values. Therefore, this case is not possible.

3. If $|a_3| = \frac{1}{2}|a_2|$, then $|a_2|$ must be even. Since $|a_3| = |a_5|$, it follows that $|a_5| = \frac{1}{2}|a_2|$. This implies that $|a_2| = 2|a_5|$. Since $|a_5| = |a_3|$, we have $|a_2| = 2|a_3|$.

4. Now, let's consider the relationship between $|a_1|$ and $|a_2|$. Since $|a_2| = 2|a_3|$, and $|a_3| = |a_1 - 3|$ (from condition (a) when $|a_1|$ is odd) or $|a_3| = \frac{1}{2}|a_1|$ (from condition (a) when $|a_1|$ is even), we have two cases:
   - If $|a_1|$ is odd, then $|a_2| = 2|a_1 - 3|$. Since $|a_2|$ is even, $|a_1 - 3|$ must be an integer. This implies that $|a_1|$ must be an odd integer greater than 3.
   - If $|a_1|$ is even, then $|a_2| = |a_1|$. Since $|a_2| = 2|a_3|$, we have $|a_1| = 2|a_3|$. This implies that $|a_1|$ must be an even integer.

5. To find the possible values of $|a_1|$, we can test even and odd integers greater than 3. We find that the possible values of $|a_1|$ are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100.

6. The sum of all possible values of $|a_1|$ is $4 + 6 + 8 + \ldots + 100 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times (4 + 100) = 5250$.

Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $|a_1|$ is $5250$.

문제 23:
To find the value of $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$, we can use the following approach:

First, we know that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$. This is a well-known limit that can be proven using the squeeze theorem or L'Hopital's rule.

Now, let's rewrite the given limit using this fact:

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \left(3 \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x} \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x}\right)
\]

Since $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$, it follows that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} = 1$ as well. Therefore, we can substitute this limit into our expression:

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \left(3 \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x} \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x}\right) = 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 3
\]

Thus, the value of $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$ is $3$.

문제 24:
To find the value of the integral $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx$, we first simplify the integrand:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \frac{x+1+1}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \left(1 + \frac{1}{x+1}\right) dx$$

Now, we can split the integral into two parts:

$$\int_0^{10} 1 dx + \int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx$$

The first integral is simply the area of a rectangle with height 1 and width 10, so it equals 10. The second integral can be evaluated using the substitution method. Let $u = x + 1$, then $du = dx$, and the limits of integration change from $0$ to $10$ to $1$ to $11$. Thus, we have:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx = \int_1^{11} \frac{1}{u} du = \ln|u| \bigg|_1^{11} = \ln(11) - \ln(1) = \ln(11)$$

Therefore, the value of the original integral is:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = 10 + \ln(11)$$

So, the answer is $10 + \ln(11)$.

문제 25:
Since $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}=1$,

it follows that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_n}{n}=1$.

Therefore, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$

$=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n\right)}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}$

$=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt{a_n^2+n}+a_n}$

$=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{a_n^2}{n^2}+1}+\frac{a_n}{n}}$

$=\frac{1}{2}$.

Hence, the answer is $\frac{1}{2}$.

This problem tests the understanding of the limit of a sequence and the application of the limit operation rules. It is a basic problem.

문제 26:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given curve and the conditions for the solid. The curve is given by $y=\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}$, and the solid has a base enclosed by this curve, the $x$-axis, and the lines $x=1, x=e$. The cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are squares.

Given that the cross-sections are squares, the side length of each square is equal to the height of the curve at that point. Therefore, the area of each cross-section is the square of the height, which is $y^2$.

The volume of the solid can be found by integrating the area of the cross-sections from $x=1$ to $x=e$. This gives us the integral:
\[
V = \int_{1}^{e} y^2 \, dx = \int_{1}^{e} \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} \, dx
\]

To evaluate this integral, we can use the substitution $u = x + \ln x$. This implies that $du = (1 + \frac{1}{x}) \, dx$.

However, to directly find the volume without integrating, we can observe that the integrand $\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x+\ln x}$. This is because:
\[
\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} = \frac{x}{x(x+\ln x)} + \frac{1}{x(x+\ln x)} = \frac{1}{x+\ln x} + \frac{1}{x}
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:
\[
V = \int_{1}^{e} \left(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x+\ln x}\right) \, dx
\]

This integral can be evaluated as:
\[
V = \left[\ln x + \ln(x+\ln x)\right]_{1}^{e}
\]

Substituting the limits of integration:
\[
V = \left[\ln e + \ln(e+\ln e)\right] - \left[\ln 1 + \ln(1+\ln 1)\right]
\]

Since $\ln e = 1$ and $\ln 1 = 0$, this simplifies to:
\[
V = 1 + \ln(e+1) - 0 - \ln 1 = 1 + \ln(e+1)
\]

Therefore, the volume of the solid is $1 + \ln(e+1)$.

문제 27:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and then apply the appropriate mathematical concepts and techniques.

Given that $f(x)$ is a cubic function with leading coefficient 1, we can express it as $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x$. Substituting the expression for $f(x)$, we get:

\[g(x) = (e^x)^3 + a(e^x)^2 + be^x + c + e^x\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[g(x) = e^{3x} + ae^{2x} + (b+1)e^x + c\]

Given that the tangent to the curve $y=g(x)$ at the point $(0, g(0))$ is the $x$-axis, we know that the slope of the tangent at this point is $0$. The slope of the tangent to a curve at a point is given by the derivative of the function at that point. Therefore, we have:

\[g'(x) = 3e^{3x} + 2ae^{2x} + (b+1)e^x\]

Evaluating $g'(0)$ gives us:

\[g'(0) = 3 + 2a + (b+1) = 0\]

Since $g(x)$ has an inverse function $h(x)$, we know that $h(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$. The derivative of the inverse function $h'(x)$ is given by the reciprocal of the derivative of $g(x)$ evaluated at $h(x)$. That is:

\[h'(x) = \frac{1}{g'(h(x))}\]

To find $h'(8)$, we need to evaluate $g'(h(8))$. However, we do not have the explicit expression for $h(x)$, and we do not need it to find $h'(8)$. Instead, we use the fact that $g(0) = 8$ (since $h(8) = 0$ and $h(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$). Therefore, we evaluate $g'(0)$ to find $h'(8)$:

\[h'(8) = \frac{1}{g'(0)} = \frac{1}{3 + 2a + (b+1)}\]

Since we know that $3 + 2a + (b+1) = 0$, we have:

\[h'(8) = \frac{1}{0}\]

However, this result is not possible because the derivative of a function cannot be undefined at a point where the function is defined. This indicates that there might be a mistake in the interpretation of the problem or the solution provided. Let's re-evaluate the given information and the steps taken to solve the problem.

Upon re-evaluation, it seems that there was a mistake in the interpretation of the problem. The correct approach to find $h'(8)$ involves using the chain rule and the fact that $g(0) = 8$. Since $h(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$, we have $h(g(x)) = x$. Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$ gives us:

\[h'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = 1\]

Evaluating at $x=0$ and knowing that $g(0) = 8$, we get:

\[h'(8) \cdot g'(0) = 1\]

Since $g'(0) = 3 + 2a + (b+1) = 0$, we have a contradiction because $g'(0)$ cannot be $0$ if $h'(8)$ is to be defined. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the given information or the interpretation of the problem.

To proceed with the correct solution, we need to ensure that $g'(0) \neq 0$ and use the chain rule to find $h'(8)$. However, without the correct values for $a$ and $b$, we cannot determine the exact value of $h'(8)$.

Given the information provided and the steps taken, it seems that there was a mistake in the interpretation of the problem or the solution provided. To find the correct value of $h'(8)$, we need to ensure that $g'(0) \neq 0$ and use the chain rule to find $h'(8)$ based on the given conditions. Without the correct values for $a$ and $b$, we cannot determine the exact value of $h'(8)$.

Therefore, the correct answer is that we cannot determine the exact value of $h'(8)$ with the given information.

문제 28:
Since $f'(x) = -x + e^{1-x^2}$, we have $f'(1) = -1 + e^{1-1^2} = e - 1$.

The equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $(1, f(1))$ is $y - f(1) = (e-1)(x-1)$, which simplifies to $y = (e-1)x + f(1) - e + 1$.

The intersection point of the tangent line and the $y$-axis is $(0, f(1) - e + 1)$.

Therefore, $g(t) = \int_{0}^{t} [f(x) - (e-1)x - f(1) + e - 1] dx$.

Thus, $g'(t) = f(t) - (e-1)t - f(1) + e - 1$.

So, $g(1) + g'(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [f(x) - (e-1)x - f(1) + e - 1] dx + f(1) - (e-1) - f(1) + e - 1 = \int_{0}^{1} [f(x) - (e-1)x] dx - 1$.

Since $f'(x) = -x + e^{1-x^2}$, we have $f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{2}e^{1-x^2} + C$.

Therefore, $g(1) + g'(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [-\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{2}e^{1-x^2} + C - (e-1)x] dx - 1 = -\frac{1}{6}x^3 - \frac{1}{2}e^{1-x^2} - \frac{1}{2}(e-1)x^2 + Cx \bigg|_{0}^{1} - 1 = -\frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{2}e + \frac{1}{2}e - \frac{1}{2} + C - 1 = C - \frac{7}{6}$.

Hence, the answer is $C - \frac{7}{6}$.

This problem tests the application of derivatives and definite integrals, as well as the ability to transform and calculate. It is a moderately difficult problem.

문제 29:
**Answer**

$10$**Solution**

Let $S_1=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(|a_n|+a_n)$ and $S_2=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(|a_n|-a_n)$. Since $S_1+S_2=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n|$ and $S_1-S_2=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$, we have $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n|=\frac{30}{3}$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n=\frac{10}{3}$. Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^na_n=\frac{1}{2}(S_1-S_2)=\frac{10}{3}$. Let $b_n=(-1)^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}a_n$, then $b_{2n-1}=(-1)^na_n$ and $b_{2n}=(-1)^{n+1}a_n$. Therefore, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_n=\frac{1}{2}(S_1-S_2)=\frac{10}{3}$. Let $T_n=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}b_{m+k}$, then $T_n=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}b_{m+k}=\sum_{k=1}^{2n}b_k-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k+\sum_{k=2n+1}^{m+2n}b_k$. Since $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}T_n>\frac{1}{700}$, we have $\frac{10}{3}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k>\frac{1}{700}$. Therefore, $\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k<\frac{2099}{2100}$. Since $b_n\geq0$ for odd $n$ and $b_n\leq0$ for even $n$, we have $\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k\geq b_1+b_3+\cdots+b_{2\left[\frac{m-1}{2}\right]+1}$. Since $b_1+b_3+\cdots+b_{2\left[\frac{m-1}{2}\right]+1}\geq\frac{10}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\left[\frac{m-1}{2}\right]}$, we have $\frac{10}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\left[\frac{m-1}{2}\right]}<\frac{2099}{2100}$. Therefore, $\left[\frac{m-1}{2}\right]<10$, which implies $m<21$. When $m=1,2,\cdots,20$, we have $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}T_n=\frac{10}{3}-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}b_k>\frac{1}{700}$. When $m=21$, we have $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}T_n=\frac{10}{3}-\sum_{k=1}^{20}b_k=\frac{10}{3}-(b_1+b_3+\cdots+b_{19})-(b_2+b_4+\cdots+b_{20})=\frac{10}{3}-(b_1+b_3+\cdots+b_{19})-(b_1+b_3+\cdots+b_{17}+b_{19})+b_{20}=\frac{10}{3}-2(b_1+b_3+\cdots+b_{19})+b_{20}=\frac{10}{3}-2\times\frac{10}{3}\times\frac{1}{2^{10}}-\frac{10}{3}\times\frac{1}{2^{10}}=\frac{10}{3}-\frac{10}{3}\times\frac{3}{2^{10}}=\frac{10}{3}\times\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{10}}\right)<\frac{1}{700}$. Therefore, the sum of all such $m$ is $1+2+\cdots+20=210$. $\square$

문제 30:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the derivative of $f(x)$:

$$f'(x) = a\cos(ax + b + \sin x) + \cos(ax + b + \sin x)\cos x$$

Given that $f'(0) = f'(4\pi)$, we have:

$$a + \cos b = a\cos(4\pi a + b) + \cos(4\pi a + b)$$

Since $1 \leq a \leq 2$, we can deduce that $\cos b = \cos(4\pi a + b)$. This implies that $b = 4\pi a + b + 2k\pi$ for some integer $k$. Solving for $a$, we get $a = -\frac{k}{2\pi}$. However, since $1 \leq a \leq 2$, the only possible value for $k$ is $-2\pi$, which gives us $a = 1$.

Now, let's find the values of $b$ that satisfy the given conditions. Since $f(0) = 0$ and $f(2\pi) = 2\pi a + b$, we have:

$$\sin b = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin(2\pi + b) = 2\pi + b$$

This implies that $b = 0$ or $b = 2\pi$. However, since $b = 4\pi a + b + 2k\pi$ and $a = 1$, we have $b = 2k\pi$. Therefore, the only possible value for $b$ is $0$.

Now, let's find the local maxima of $f(x)$. The derivative $f'(x)$ can be rewritten as:

$$f'(x) = \cos(x + b + \sin x)(a + \cos x)$$

Since $a = 1$ and $b = 0$, we have:

$$f'(x) = \cos(x + \sin x)(1 + \cos x)$$

The local maxima occur when $f'(x) = 0$ and $f''(x) < 0$. The derivative $f'(x)$ is $0$ when $\cos(x + \sin x) = 0$ or $\cos x = -1$. The smallest positive $x$ where $\cos(x + \sin x) = 0$ is $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the smallest element of $A$ is $\alpha_1 = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

To find the number of elements in $A$, we note that $f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi$ for any integer $k$. Since $0 < \alpha < 4\pi$, the possible values for $\alpha$ are $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\frac{5\pi}{2}$, and $\frac{9\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $n = 3$.

Finally, we have:

$$n\alpha_1 - ab = 3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} - 1 \cdot 0 = \frac{3\pi}{2}$$

Therefore, $p = 2$ and $q = 3$, so the value of $p + q$ is $5$.
