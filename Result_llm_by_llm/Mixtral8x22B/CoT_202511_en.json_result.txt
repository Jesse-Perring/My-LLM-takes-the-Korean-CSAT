문제 1:
To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the expression given can be simplified by understanding the properties of exponents and roots.

The expression is $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$.

First, we know that $\sqrt[3]{5}$ is the cube root of 5, which can also be written as $5^{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Next, we look at $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Since 25 is $5^2$, we can rewrite $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ as $(5^2)^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Using the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we can simplify this to $5^{\frac{2}{3}}$.

Now, we have the expression as $5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}}$.

Using the rule for multiplying powers with the same base, which states that $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$, we can combine the exponents:

$5^{\frac{1}{3}} \times 5^{\frac{2}{3}} = 5^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}} = 5^1$.

Since $5^1 = 5$, the value of the original expression $\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is $5$.

Therefore, the answer is $5$.

문제 2:
The given limit is the definition of the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=2$.

So, first we find the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8$.

Then we evaluate $f'(2)$ to find the value of the limit.

$f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 8 = 3*4 - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4$.

Therefore, the value of $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$ is $4$.

문제 3:
Given that the first term and common ratio of the geometric sequence $\{a_n\}$ are both equal to a positive number $k$, we can express the terms of the sequence as follows:

- The first term, $a_1 = k$.
- The second term, $a_2 = k \cdot k = k^2$.
- The fourth term, $a_4 = k \cdot k \cdot k \cdot k = k^4$.

Given the equation $$\frac{a_4}{a_2}+\frac{a_2}{a_1}=30$$, we substitute the expressions for $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_4$ into this equation:

$$\frac{k^4}{k^2} + \frac{k^2}{k} = 30$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$k^2 + k = 30$$

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we have:

$$k^2 + k - 30 = 0$$

Factoring the quadratic equation, we find:

$$(k + 6)(k - 5) = 0$$

Since $k$ is a positive number, we discard the negative root and take $k = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $k$ is $5$.

문제 4:
For a function to be continuous, the value of the function as we approach a point from the left must be equal to the value of the function as we approach the same point from the right. In this case, we are given that the function is continuous for all real numbers, so we need to ensure that the function is continuous at $x = -2$.

Let's find the value of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $-2$ from the left and from the right.

For $x < -2$, the function is $f(x) = 5x + a$. As $x$ approaches $-2$ from the left, we have:
\[ \lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^-} (5x + a) = 5(-2) + a = -10 + a \]

For $x \geq -2$, the function is $f(x) = x^2 - a$. As $x$ approaches $-2$ from the right, we have:
\[ \lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2^+} (x^2 - a) = (-2)^2 - a = 4 - a \]

For the function to be continuous at $x = -2$, these two limits must be equal:
\[ -10 + a = 4 - a \]

Now, let's solve for $a$:
\[ -10 + a = 4 - a \]
\[ 2a = 14 \]
\[ a = 7 \]

Therefore, the value of the constant $a$ that makes the function continuous for all real numbers is $7$.

문제 5:
To find the value of $f'(1)$, we first need to find the derivative of $f(x)$. The function is given by $f(x) = (x^2 + 1)(3x^2 - x)$.

Using the product rule for differentiation, which states that $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$, where $u$ and $v$ are functions of $x$, we can find the derivative of $f(x)$.

Let $u(x) = x^2 + 1$ and $v(x) = 3x^2 - x$.

Then, $u'(x) = 2x$ and $v'(x) = 6x - 1$.

Now, we can find $f'(x)$:

$f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)$

$f'(x) = (2x)(3x^2 - x) + (x^2 + 1)(6x - 1)$

Now, we need to find $f'(1)$. To do this, we substitute $x = 1$ into $f'(x)$:

$f'(1) = (2(1))(3(1)^2 - 1) + ((1)^2 + 1)(6(1) - 1)$

$f'(1) = (2)(3 - 1) + (1 + 1)(6 - 1)$

$f'(1) = (2)(2) + (2)(5)$

$f'(1) = 4 + 10$

$f'(1) = 14$

Therefore, the value of $f'(1)$ is $14$.

문제 6:
Solution: We know that $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta\right) = -\sin \theta$. Given that $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta\right) = -\frac{1}{5}$, we can deduce that $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$.

Now, we want to find the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$. We know that $1-\cos^2 \theta = \sin^2 \theta$ (by the Pythagorean identity).

So, $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$.

Since we know that $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{5}$, we can substitute this value in to get $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{5}} = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $\frac{\sin \theta}{1-\cos^2 \theta}$ is $5$.

Answer: $5$

문제 7:
To find the value of $f(1)$, we first need to find the expression for $f(x)$. Since we are given the integral of $f(x)$ from $0$ to $x$, we can find $f(x)$ by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to $x$.

Given: $$ \int_0^x f(t) dt = 3x^3 + 2x $$

Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$ using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we get:

$$ f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( 3x^3 + 2x \right) $$

Now, differentiate the right side of the equation:

$$ f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( 3x^3 \right) + \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \right) $$

$$ f(x) = 9x^2 + 2 $$

Now that we have the expression for $f(x)$, we can find $f(1)$ by substituting $x = 1$ into the expression:

$$ f(1) = 9(1)^2 + 2 $$

$$ f(1) = 9 + 2 $$

$$ f(1) = 11 $$

Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $11$.

문제 8:
To find the value of \(a \times b\), we first need to simplify \(a\) and \(b\) separately.

For \(a\), we have:
\(a = 2 \log \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} + \log_2 20\)

Using the property of logarithms that \(\log \frac{1}{x} = -\log x\), we can rewrite the first term:
\(a = -2 \log \sqrt{10} + \log_2 20\)

Since \(\sqrt{10} = 10^{\frac{1}{2}}\), we can further simplify:
\(a = -2 \log 10^{\frac{1}{2}} + \log_2 20\)

Using the property of logarithms that \(\log x^y = y \log x\), we get:
\(a = -\log 10 + \log_2 20\)

Since \(\log 10 = 1\) (because \(10^1 = 10\)), we have:
\(a = -1 + \log_2 20\)

Now, we can express \(\log_2 20\) as \(\log_2 (2^2 \cdot 5)\), which is:
\(a = -1 + \log_2 (2^2 \cdot 5)\)

Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b (x \cdot y) = \log_b x + \log_b y\), we get:
\(a = -1 + 2 \log_2 2 + \log_2 5\)

Since \(\log_2 2 = 1\) (because \(2^1 = 2\)), we have:
\(a = -1 + 2 + \log_2 5\)

Therefore, \(a = 1 + \log_2 5\).

For \(b\), we have:
\(b = \log 2\)

Now, we can find \(a \times b\):
\(a \times b = (1 + \log_2 5) \times \log 2\)

Using the change of base formula, \(\log_b x = \frac{\log_a x}{\log_a b}\), we can express \(\log_2 5\) in terms of \(\log\):
\(a \times b = (1 + \frac{\log 5}{\log 2}) \times \log 2\)

Expanding the expression, we get:
\(a \times b = \log 2 + \log 5\)

Since \(\log 2 + \log 5 = \log (2 \cdot 5) = \log 10\), and \(\log 10 = 1\), we have:
\(a \times b = 1\)

Therefore, the value of \(a \times b\) is $1$.

문제 9:
To find the positive value of $a$ that satisfies the given condition, we first need to find the antiderivative of $f(x)$, which is $F(x) = x^3 - 8x^2 - 20x$.

Given that $\int_{-2}^a f(x) dx = \int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx$, we can use the antiderivative to rewrite this as $F(a) - F(-2) = F(0) - F(-2)$.

Now, we can substitute the values into the equation:

$F(a) - F(-2) = F(0) - F(-2)$

$a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a - ((-2)^3 - 8(-2)^2 - 20(-2)) = 0^3 - 8(0)^2 - 20(0) - ((-2)^3 - 8(-2)^2 - 20(-2))$

Simplifying both sides:

$a^3 - 8a^2 - 20a + 8 = 0$

Now, we need to find the positive value of $a$ that satisfies this equation. By factoring or using numerical methods, we find that $a = 2$.

Therefore, the positive value of $a$ that satisfies the given condition is $2$.

문제 10:
To find the minimum value of $a+b$ for the function $f(x)=a \cos bx + 3$ given that it has a maximum value of 13 at $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the maximum value of $f(x)$**: Given that $f(x)$ has a maximum value of 13 at $x=\frac{\pi}{3}$, we can write this as:
\[f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = a \cos\left(b \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 3 = 13\]

2. **Solve for $a$**: From the equation above, we can isolate $a$ by subtracting 3 from both sides and then dividing by $\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right)$:
\[a = \frac{13 - 3}{\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right)} = \frac{10}{\cos\left(\frac{b\pi}{3}\right)}\]

3. **Determine the range of $b$**: Since $f(x)$ is defined on the closed interval $[0,2\pi]$, the period $T$ of the cosine function must be such that $T \geq 2\pi$. The period $T$ of $\cos(bx)$ is given by $T = \frac{2\pi}{b}$. Therefore, we have:
\[\frac{2\pi}{b} \geq 2\pi \implies b \leq 1\]

4. **Find the minimum value of $a$**: Since $a$ is a natural number and $b \leq 1$, the smallest value of $b$ that satisfies this condition is $b = 1$. Substituting $b = 1$ into the expression for $a$, we get:
\[a = \frac{10}{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)} = \frac{10}{\frac{1}{2}} = 20\]

5. **Calculate the minimum value of $a+b$**: With $a = 20$ and $b = 1$, the minimum value of $a+b$ is:
\[a + b = 20 + 1 = 21\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $a+b$ for the pair of natural numbers $(a, b)$ is $21$.

문제 11:
To find the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes, we first need to find the velocity of point P and then differentiate the velocity with respect to time to get the acceleration.

The velocity $v$ of point P at time $t$ is given by the derivative of its position $x$ with respect to time $t$:

$$ v = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( t^3 - \frac{3}{2} t^2 - 6t \right) $$

Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:

$$ v = 3t^2 - 3t - 6 $$

Now, to find the time when the direction of motion changes, we need to find the time when the velocity is zero (since the direction of motion changes when the velocity changes sign). Setting $v = 0$, we get:

$$ 3t^2 - 3t - 6 = 0 $$

This is a quadratic equation in $t$. To solve for $t$, we can factor the quadratic equation:

$$ 3(t^2 - t - 2) = 0 $$

$$ 3(t - 2)(t + 1) = 0 $$

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible values of $t$:

$$ t - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad t + 1 = 0 $$

$$ t = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 $$

Since $t \geq 0$, we discard $t = -1$ and take $t = 2$.

Now, to find the acceleration $a$ of point P at time $t = 2$, we differentiate the velocity $v$ with respect to time $t$:

$$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 3t^2 - 3t - 6 \right) $$

Using the power rule for differentiation again, we get:

$$ a = 6t - 3 $$

Substituting $t = 2$ into the expression for $a$, we get:

$$ a = 6(2) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 $$

Therefore, the acceleration of point P at the time when its direction of motion changes is $9$.

문제 12:
Given that $\{b_n\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with $b_1=2$, we can express $b_{k+1}$ as $b_1 + kd$, where $d$ is the common difference. Since $b_1=2$, we have $b_{k+1} = 2 + kd$.

The given condition is that for all natural numbers $n$, $$ \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2} n^2 $$.

Let's substitute $b_{k+1} = 2 + kd$ into the equation:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{2 + kd} = \frac{1}{2} n^2 $$

For $n=1$, we have:

$$ \frac{a_1}{2 + d} = \frac{1}{2} $$

Since $a_1=2$, we can solve for $d$:

$$ \frac{2}{2 + d} = \frac{1}{2} $$

$$ 4 = 2 + d $$

$$ d = 2 $$

Now we know that $b_{k+1} = 2 + 2k = 2(k+1)$.

Substituting $b_{k+1} = 2(k+1)$ back into the original equation, we get:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{2(k+1)} = \frac{1}{2} n^2 $$

Simplifying, we have:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{k+1} = n^2 $$

Now, let's find the value of $a_k$ for each $k$. For $n=1$, we have:

$$ \frac{a_1}{2} = 1 $$

Since $a_1=2$, this is consistent with our given information.

For $n=2$, we have:

$$ \frac{a_1}{2} + \frac{a_2}{3} = 4 $$

We already know $a_1=2$, so we can solve for $a_2$:

$$ 1 + \frac{a_2}{3} = 4 $$

$$ \frac{a_2}{3} = 3 $$

$$ a_2 = 9 $$

For $n=3$, we have:

$$ \frac{a_1}{2} + \frac{a_2}{3} + \frac{a_3}{4} = 9 $$

We know $a_1=2$ and $a_2=9$, so we can solve for $a_3$:

$$ 1 + 3 + \frac{a_3}{4} = 9 $$

$$ \frac{a_3}{4} = 5 $$

$$ a_3 = 20 $$

Continuing this pattern, we find that $a_4 = 35$ and $a_5 = 56$.

Therefore, the value of $\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k$ is:

$$ 2 + 9 + 20 + 35 + 56 = 122 $$

So, the answer is $122$.

문제 13:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the cubic function $f(x)$ that satisfies the given conditions. Since the leading coefficient is 1, we can express $f(x)$ as:

$$f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$$

Given that $f(1) = f(2) = 0$, we can set up the following system of equations:

1. $1 + a + b + c = 0$
2. $8 + 4a + 2b + c = 0$

The derivative of $f(x)$ is:

$$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b$$

Given that $f'(0) = -7$, we have:

3. $b = -7$

Now we have a system of three equations with three unknowns:

1. $1 + a + b + c = 0$
2. $8 + 4a + 2b + c = 0$
3. $b = -7$

Solving this system, we find:

$$a = 3, \quad b = -7, \quad c = 3$$

Thus, the cubic function is:

$$f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - 7x + 3$$

Now, let's find the coordinates of point Q. Since Q is the intersection of the curve $y = f(x)$ and the segment OP other than P, we can set up the equation:

$$f(x) = \frac{f(3)}{3}x$$

Substituting $f(x)$ and $f(3)$ into the equation, we get:

$$x^3 + 3x^2 - 7x + 3 = \frac{21}{3}x$$

Simplifying, we find:

$$x^3 + 3x^2 - 14x + 3 = 0$$

Let $x_1$ be the x-coordinate of point Q. Then, by Vieta's formulas, we have:

$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -3$$

Since $x_2 = 1$ and $x_3 = 2$, we have:

$$x_1 + 1 + 2 = -3$$

Solving for $x_1$, we find:

$$x_1 = -6$$

Thus, the coordinates of point Q are $(-6, f(-6))$.

Now, let's calculate the areas $A$ and $B$. The area $A$ is given by:

$$A = \int_{0}^{-6} f(x) dx$$

And the area $B$ is given by:

$$B = \int_{-6}^{3} f(x) dx$$

To find $B - A$, we can use the following property of definite integrals:

$$B - A = \int_{-6}^{3} f(x) dx - \int_{0}^{-6} f(x) dx = \int_{0}^{3} f(x) dx$$

Evaluating this integral, we find:

$$B - A = \left[ \frac{1}{4}x^4 + x^3 - \frac{7}{2}x^2 + 3x \right]_{0}^{3} = \frac{27}{4} + 27 - \frac{63}{2} + 9 = \frac{27}{4}$$

Therefore, the value of $B - A$ is $\frac{27}{4}$.

문제 14:
This problem involves a complex application of geometry and trigonometry, and it requires a deep understanding of these concepts to solve. Here's a simplified breakdown of the solution:

1. Since $\sin A: \sin C=8:5$, and knowing that $\sin A/\sin C = \overline{AC}/\overline{AB}$, we can find that $\overline{AC}/\overline{AB} = 8/5$.

2. Given that $\overline{AD}:\overline{DB}=3:2$, and knowing that $\overline{AD}+\overline{DB}=\overline{AB}$, we can find that $\overline{AD}=3/5*\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{DB}=2/5*\overline{AB}$.

3. Since O is the circle centered at A passing through D, and E is the intersection of circle O and segment AC, we can find that $\triangle ADE$ is similar to $\triangle ABC$. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Given that the ratio of the areas of triangles ADE and ABC is $9:35$, we can find that $\overline{AE}/\overline{AC} = 3/7$.

4. Knowing that $\overline{AC}/\overline{AB} = 8/5$ and $\overline{AE}/\overline{AC} = 3/7$, we can find that $\overline{AE}/\overline{AB} = 24/35$.

5. Given that the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is 7, we can find that $\overline{AB} = 2*7*\sin C = 14*\sin C$.

6. The maximum area of triangle PBC for a point P on circle O is achieved when P is the point where the extension of AB intersects circle O. This is because the height of triangle PBC is maximized in this case. The area of triangle PBC can be found using the formula $1/2*base*height$.

7. Substituting the values we found into this formula, we can find the maximum area of triangle PBC.

This problem is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of geometry and trigonometry to solve. It's a great problem for practicing these concepts, but it's not a simple problem that can be solved with basic arithmetic.

문제 15:
This problem involves calculus and the properties of quadratic and cubic functions.

Given that $g(x)$ is differentiable for all real numbers, we know that $f(x)$ must also be differentiable for $x > 0$. Since $f(x)$ is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, it is continuous and differentiable for all $x$.

The derivative of $g(x)$ for $x \leq 0$ is $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + 15$. The equation $g'(x) \times g'(x-4) = 0$ has 4 distinct real roots, which means that $g'(x) = 0$ and $g'(x-4) = 0$ each have 2 distinct real roots.

Let's denote the roots of $g'(x) = 0$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$, and the roots of $g'(x-4) = 0$ as $x_3$ and $x_4$. Since $g'(x-4) = 0$ is equivalent to $g'(x) = 0$ shifted 4 units to the right, we have $x_3 = x_1 + 4$ and $x_4 = x_2 + 4$.

Given that $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + 15$, we can find the sum and product of its roots using Vieta's formulas: $x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{2a}{3}$ and $x_1x_2 = 5$.

Since $x_3 = x_1 + 4$ and $x_4 = x_2 + 4$, we have $x_3 + x_4 = x_1 + x_2 + 8 = -\frac{2a}{3} + 8$ and $x_3x_4 = (x_1 + 4)(x_2 + 4) = x_1x_2 + 4(x_1 + x_2) + 16 = 5 - \frac{8a}{3} + 16$.

Given that $x_3 + x_4 = -\frac{2a}{3} + 8$ and $x_3x_4 = 5 - \frac{8a}{3} + 16$, we can solve for $a$ using the fact that $x_3x_4 = x_1x_2 + 4(x_1 + x_2) + 16$. This gives us $a = 3$.

However, we are given that $a \neq 3\sqrt{5}$, which means $a$ cannot be $3$. This is a contradiction, and the problem as stated does not have a valid solution.

If we assume that the condition $a \neq 3\sqrt{5}$ is a typo and should be $a \neq 3$, then we can proceed with the solution. In this case, we would find the value of $a$ using the given conditions and then calculate $g(-2) + g(2)$. However, without the correct condition, we cannot determine the value of $g(-2) + g(2)$.

Therefore, the problem as stated is unsolvable, and we cannot provide a valid answer.

문제 16:
To solve for the real number $x$ that satisfies the given equation, we start by expressing both logarithms in terms of the same base. Since $\log_4(y) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(y)$, we can rewrite the given equation as:

\[
\log_2(x-3) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3x-5)
\]

Next, we use the property of logarithms that allows us to remove the logarithm from both sides by raising 2 to the power of each side:

\[
2^{\log_2(x-3)} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}\log_2(3x-5)}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x-3 = (3x-5)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives:

\[
(x-3)^2 = 3x-5
\]

Expanding the left side and simplifying the equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 = 3x - 5
\]

Rearranging the terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 9x + 14 = 0
\]

Factoring the quadratic equation:

\[
(x-2)(x-7) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the possible solutions for $x$:

\[
x-2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x-7 = 0
\]

Solving for $x$ in each case:

\[
x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 7
\]

However, we must check that each solution satisfies the original equation and the conditions for the logarithms to be defined. For $x=2$, substituting into the original equation gives:

\[
\log_2(2-3) = \log_4(3(2)-5)
\]

This is not possible since the argument of a logarithm must be positive. Therefore, $x=2$ is not a valid solution. For $x=7$, substituting into the original equation gives:

\[
\log_2(7-3) = \log_4(3(7)-5)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\log_2(4) = \log_4(16)
\]

Which is true since $\log_2(4) = 2$ and $\log_4(16) = 2$. Therefore, the only valid solution is $x=7$.

Thus, the real number $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $7$.

문제 17:
To find the value of $f(2)$, we first need to find the original function $f(x)$ by integrating the given derivative $f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x$.

The integral of $9x^2$ with respect to $x$ is $3x^3$, and the integral of $4x$ with respect to $x$ is $2x^2$. So, the original function $f(x)$ is:

$f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + C$

where $C$ is the constant of integration.

We are given that $f(1) = 6$, so we can use this to find the value of $C$:

$f(1) = 3(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + C = 3 + 2 + C = 6$

Solving for $C$, we get:

$C = 6 - 3 - 2 = 1$

So, the original function is:

$f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1$

Now, we can find the value of $f(2)$:

$f(2) = 3(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 1 = 3(8) + 2(4) + 1 = 24 + 8 + 1 = 33$

Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is $33$.

문제 18:
To find the value of $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n$, we first need to understand the given sequence $\{a_n\}$ where $a_n + a_{n+4} = 12$. This implies that every four terms in the sequence sum up to 12.

Given that the sum is from $n=1$ to $16$, we have a total of $16$ terms. Since every four terms sum up to $12$, we can group these terms into four-term groups:

- The first group consists of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$.
- The second group consists of $a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8$.
- The third group consists of $a_9, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}$.
- The fourth group consists of $a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16}$.

Since each group sums up to $12$, and we have $4$ such groups, the total sum of the sequence is $4 \times 12 = 48$.

However, we must also consider the terms $a_{17}$ and $a_{18}$ that are included in the sum but not in the four-term groups. Since $a_{17} + a_{18} = 12$ (as per the given sequence rule), we need to add this sum to our total.

Therefore, the total sum of the sequence is $48 + 12 = 60$.

So, the value of $\sum_{n=1}^{16} a_n$ is $60$.

문제 19:
To find the value of f(3), we first need to find the value of 'a' that satisfies the condition that the maximum value of f(x) is 7/27.

The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2.

The maximum value of f(x) occurs at a critical point, which can be found by setting f'(x) = 0.

So, 6x^2 - 6ax - 12a^2 = 0.

This can be factored to 6(x^2 - ax - 2a^2) = 0.

The roots of this equation are x = a and x = -2a.

Since 'a' is positive, the maximum value of f(x) occurs at x = a.

Substituting x = a into f(x), we get f(a) = 2a^3 - 3a^3 - 12a^3 = -13a^3.

We are given that the maximum value of f(x) is 7/27, so -13a^3 = 7/27.

Solving for 'a', we get a = (7/27)^(1/3) / (-13)^(1/3).

Now that we have the value of 'a', we can find f(3) by substituting x = 3 and the value of 'a' into f(x).

f(3) = 2(3)^3 - 3(7/27)^(1/3) / (-13)^(1/3) (3)^2 - 12(7/27)^(2/3) / (-13)^(2/3) (3).

Simplifying this expression will give us the value of f(3).

However, this problem requires numerical computation, which is beyond the capabilities of this model. Therefore, I recommend using a calculator or computer software to find the numerical value of f(3).

문제 20:
To find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$, we first need to determine the value of $k$.

Given that $k$ is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point of the curve $y=\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ and the line $y=x$, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $k$:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{k-3} = k
\]

This equation does not have an elementary solution, so we cannot find an exact value for $k$ without using numerical methods or graphing. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that $k$ is a real number that satisfies this equation.

Next, we are given that for all $x > k$, $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$. We are also given that $f(f(x)) = 3x$.

Let's define $g(x) = f(f(x))$. Then we have:

\[
g(x) = 3x
\]

Since $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ for $x > k$, we can substitute $f(x)$ into $g(x)$ to get:

\[
g(x) = f(f(x)) = f\left(\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}\right) = 3x
\]

Now, we need to find the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Let's define $t = \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}$. We want to find $f(t)$.

Since $t$ is a function of $k$, and we know that $k$ satisfies the equation $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{k-3} = k$, we can express $t$ in terms of $k$:

\[
t = \frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}} = \frac{1}{k^3 \times (k^3)^3} = \frac{1}{k^3 \times k^9} = \frac{1}{k^{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find a value of $x$ such that $f(x) = t$. Since $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ for $x > k$, we can set $t$ equal to $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ and solve for $x$:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = \frac{1}{k^{12}}
\]

Taking the logarithm base $\frac{1}{5}$ of both sides, we get:

\[
x - 3 = \log_{\frac{1}{5}}\left(\frac{1}{k^{12}}\right) = 12\log_{\frac{1}{5}}(k)
\]

Since $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{k-3} = k$, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
x - 3 = 12(k - 3)
\]

Solving for $x$, we get:

\[
x = 12k - 33
\]

Now, we want to find $f(t) = f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$. Since $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}$ for $x > k$, and we have found that $x = 12k - 33$, we can substitute $x$ into $f(x)$:

\[
f(t) = f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) = f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{12k-33-3} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{12k-36}
\]

Since $f(f(x)) = 3x$, we can substitute $f(x)$ into $f(f(x))$ to get:

\[
f(f(x)) = f\left(\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{x-3}\right) = 3x
\]

Substituting $x = 12k - 33$ into the equation, we get:

\[
f\left(\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^{12k-36}\right) = 3(12k - 33)
\]

Therefore, the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right)$ is:

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{k^3 \times 5^{3k}}\right) = 3(12k - 33)
\]

However, since we do not have an exact value for $k$, we cannot simplify this expression further. The final answer is:

\[
3(12k - 33)
\]

문제 21:
To find the maximum value of $f(1)$, we first need to ensure that the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(2x+1)}{f(x)}$ exists for all real $\alpha$. This implies that $f(x)$ cannot be zero at $x = a$ or $x = 2a + 1$ because division by zero is undefined.

Given $f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + 4$, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a) \neq 0$ and $f(2a + 1) \neq 0$.

Let's consider the case when $a = 0$. In this case, $f(x) = x^3 + b x + 4$. Since $f(0) = 4 \neq 0$, the condition is satisfied. Now we need to ensure that $f(2a + 1) = f(1) \neq 0$. Substituting $a = 0$ into $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 1^3 + b \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + b$. For $f(1) \neq 0$, $b$ cannot be $-5$.

Now, let's find the maximum value of $f(1)$ for $a = 0$ and $b \neq -5$. We have $f(1) = 5 + b$. Since $b$ can be any integer except $-5$, the maximum value of $f(1)$ occurs when $b$ is maximized. However, since we are not given any constraints on the maximum value of $b$, we cannot determine the absolute maximum value of $f(1)$.

Therefore, without additional constraints on $b$, we cannot determine the maximum value of $f(1)$. However, for $a = 0$ and $b \neq -5$, the expression for $f(1)$ is $5 + b$, and the maximum value of $f(1)$ would depend on the maximum value of $b$ that satisfies the given conditions.

In conclusion, without further constraints on $b$, we cannot determine the maximum value of $f(1)$. However, for $a = 0$ and $b \neq -5$, the expression for $f(1)$ is $5 + b$, and the maximum value of $f(1)$ would depend on the maximum value of $b$ that satisfies the given conditions.

문제 22:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and find all possible values of $|a_1|$ that satisfy both conditions (a) and (b).

Condition (a) gives us a recursive formula for $a_{n+1}$ based on the value of $a_n$. If $|a_n|$ is odd, then $a_{n+1} = a_n - 3$. If $a_n = 0$ or $|a_n|$ is even, then $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} a_n$.

Condition (b) tells us that the smallest natural number $m$ such that $|a_m| = |a_{m+2}|$ is 3. This means that the sequence repeats every 3 terms, starting from the third term.

Let's analyze the sequence step by step:

1. Since $|a_m| = |a_{m+2}|$, we know that the sequence repeats every 3 terms. Therefore, we can focus on the first 3 terms to understand the pattern.

2. Let's consider the case when $|a_1|$ is odd. According to condition (a), $a_2 = a_1 - 3$. Since $|a_1|$ is odd, $|a_2|$ will be even. Then, $a_3 = \frac{1}{2} a_2$. Since $|a_2|$ is even, $|a_3|$ will also be even.

3. Now, let's consider the case when $|a_1|$ is even. According to condition (a), $a_2 = \frac{1}{2} a_1$. Since $|a_1|$ is even, $|a_2|$ will also be even. Then, $a_3 = \frac{1}{2} a_2$. Since $|a_2|$ is even, $|a_3|$ will also be even.

4. In both cases, we see that $|a_3|$ is even. Since the sequence repeats every 3 terms, $|a_6| = |a_3|$ will also be even. This means that the sequence cannot satisfy condition (b) if $|a_1|$ is even, because $|a_3|$ would not be equal to $|a_1|$.

5. Therefore, $|a_1|$ must be odd. Let's find the possible values of $|a_1|$ that satisfy condition (b). Since $|a_3|$ is even, $|a_1|$ must be such that after subtracting 3 twice (to get $a_2$ and $a_3$), we end up with an even number. This means that $|a_1|$ must be of the form $3k + 1$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.

6. Now, let's check if all values of $|a_1|$ of the form $3k + 1$ satisfy condition (b). If $|a_1| = 3k + 1$, then $a_2 = 3k - 2$ and $a_3 = \frac{3}{2}k - 1$. Since $|a_3|$ is even, $k$ must be even. Therefore, $|a_1|$ must be of the form $6n + 1$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.

7. We can verify that all values of $|a_1|$ of the form $6n + 1$ satisfy condition (b). For example, if $|a_1| = 7$, then $a_2 = 4$, $a_3 = 2$, $a_4 = 1$, $a_5 = -2$, $a_6 = -1$, and $|a_6| = |a_1|$.

8. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $|a_1|$ is the sum of all numbers of the form $6n + 1$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. This is an arithmetic series with the first term $a_1 = 1$ and common difference $d = 6$. The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series is given by $S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d]$. However, since we are looking for the sum of all possible values of $|a_1|$, we need to find the sum of an infinite series. This is not possible to calculate directly, as the sum would be infinite.

In conclusion, the sum of all possible values of $|a_1|$ is not a finite number, as there are infinitely many values of $|a_1|$ that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the answer to the problem is that the sum is not a finite number.

문제 23:
To find the value of the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$, we can use the well-known limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$.

First, let's rewrite the given limit using the identity $\sin^2 x = (\sin x)^2$:

$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{(\sin x)^2}$$

Now, we can separate the fraction into two parts:

$$= \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \left(3 \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x} \cdot \frac{x}{\sin x}\right)$$

Since $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$, it follows that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} = 1$ as well. Therefore, we can substitute this limit into our expression:

$$= 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1$$

$$= 3$$

Thus, the value of the limit $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{3x^2}{\sin^2 x}$ is $3$.

문제 24:
To find the value of the integral $\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx$, we first simplify the integrand:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{x+2}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \frac{x+1+1}{x+1} dx = \int_0^{10} \left(1 + \frac{1}{x+1}\right) dx$$

Now, we can split the integral into two parts:

$$\int_0^{10} dx + \int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx$$

The first integral is simply the area under the line $y=1$ from $x=0$ to $x=10$, which is $10 \cdot 1 = 10$.

The second integral can be evaluated using the substitution $u = x + 1$, $du = dx$:

$$\int_0^{10} \frac{1}{x+1} dx = \int_1^{11} \frac{1}{u} du = \ln|u| \bigg|_1^{11} = \ln(11) - \ln(1) = \ln(11)$$

Therefore, the value of the original integral is:

$$10 + \ln(11)$$

So, the answer is $10 + \ln(11)$.

문제 25:
To find the value of $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$, we start by analyzing the given limit $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3}=1$.

First, we rewrite the given limit as:
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n a_n}{n^2+3} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_n}{\frac{n^2+3}{n}} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_n}{n + \frac{3}{n}} = 1
\]

This implies that as $n$ approaches infinity, $a_n$ approaches $n + \frac{3}{n}$. However, since $\frac{3}{n}$ becomes negligible as $n$ increases, we can say that $a_n$ is approximately equal to $n$.

Now, let's find the value of $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$:
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{n^2+n}-n\right)
\]

To simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the numerator:
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{n^2+n}-n\right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{n^2+n}+n}{\sqrt{n^2+n}+n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^2+n-n^2}{\sqrt{n^2+n}+n}
\]

Simplifying the numerator, we get:
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2+n}+n}
\]

Now, we factor out $n$ from the denominator:
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n}{n\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}+1\right)}
\]

Since $\frac{1}{n}$ approaches $0$ as $n$ approaches infinity, $\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$ approaches $1$. Therefore, the denominator approaches $2$, and the expression simplifies to:
\[
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the value of $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\sqrt{a_n^2+n}-a_n\right)$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.

문제 26:
To find the volume of the solid, we need to integrate the area of the square cross-sections along the x-axis. The side length of each square cross-section is equal to the height of the curve at that x-value.

Given the curve $y=\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}$, we can find the side length of the square cross-section at any x-value by substituting x into the equation.

The volume of the solid can be found by integrating the square of the curve from x=1 to x=e:

$V = \int_{1}^{e} \left(\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)}}\right)^2 dx$

$= \int_{1}^{e} \frac{x+1}{x(x+\ln x)} dx$

This integral does not have an elementary antiderivative, so it cannot be solved using standard integration techniques. Therefore, we cannot find the exact volume of the solid using the given information.

However, we can approximate the volume using numerical integration methods, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule. To do this, we would need to evaluate the integrand at multiple points between x=1 and x=e and sum the results.

Without additional information or context, we cannot provide a numerical value for the volume of the solid.

문제 27:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given conditions and what they imply about the function $g(x)$.

1. The function $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x$ is given, where $f(x)$ is a cubic function with leading coefficient 1. This means that $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$.

2. The tangent to the curve $y = g(x)$ at the point $(0, g(0))$ is the $x$-axis. This implies that the slope of the tangent line at $x = 0$ is $0$, and the value of $g(x)$ at $x = 0$ is $0$. In other words, $g(0) = 0$ and $g'(0) = 0$.

3. The function $g(x)$ has an inverse function $h(x)$. This means that $h(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$, and $h(g(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$.

Now, let's find the value of $h'(8)$. To do this, we need to find the derivative of $h(x)$ at $x = 8$. Since $h(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that $h'(x) = \frac{1}{g'(h(x))}$.

First, let's find $g'(x)$. Since $g(x) = f(e^x) + e^x$, we can use the chain rule to find the derivative:

$g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[f(e^x)] + \frac{d}{dx}[e^x]$

$= f'(e^x) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] + e^x$

$= f'(e^x) \cdot e^x + e^x$

Now, let's find $g'(0)$. Since $g'(0) = 0$, we have:

$f'(e^0) \cdot e^0 + e^0 = 0$

$f'(1) + 1 = 0$

$f'(1) = -1$

Now, let's find $h(8)$. Since $h(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$, we have $h(8) = x$ such that $g(x) = 8$. However, we don't need to find the exact value of $h(8)$ to find $h'(8)$.

Finally, let's find $h'(8)$. Since $h'(x) = \frac{1}{g'(h(x))}$, we have:

$h'(8) = \frac{1}{g'(h(8))}$

$= \frac{1}{f'(e^{h(8)}) \cdot e^{h(8)} + e^{h(8)}}$

Since $g(h(8)) = 8$, we have $f(e^{h(8)}) + e^{h(8)} = 8$. However, we don't need to find the exact value of $e^{h(8)}$ to find $h'(8)$.

Since $f'(1) = -1$, we have:

$h'(8) = \frac{1}{f'(e^{h(8)}) \cdot e^{h(8)} + e^{h(8)}}$

$= \frac{1}{-e^{h(8)} + e^{h(8)}}$

$= \frac{1}{0}$

This is undefined, which means that $h'(8)$ does not exist.

Therefore, the value of $h'(8)$ is $\text{undefined}$.

문제 28:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at the point $(t, f(t))$. The slope of the tangent line at this point is given by the derivative $f'(t) = -t + e^{1-t^2}$. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line can be written as:

$$y - f(t) = f'(t)(x - t)$$

Substituting $f'(t) = -t + e^{1-t^2}$ and rearranging, we get:

$$y = (-t + e^{1-t^2})(x - t) + f(t)$$

Now, we need to find the intersection points of this tangent line with the curve $y=f(x)$ and the $y$-axis. The intersection with the $y$-axis occurs when $x=0$, so we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the tangent line:

$$y = (-t + e^{1-t^2})(-t) + f(t)$$

To find the intersection with the curve $y=f(x)$, we need to solve the system of equations given by the tangent line and the curve. However, since we are only interested in the value of $g(1) + g'(1)$, we can focus on the specific case when $t=1$.

When $t=1$, the slope of the tangent line is $f'(1) = -1 + e^{1-1^2} = e - 1$. The equation of the tangent line becomes:

$$y = (e - 1)(x - 1) + f(1)$$

Substituting $x=0$ to find the intersection with the $y$-axis, we get:

$$y = (e - 1)(-1) + f(1) = -e + 1 + f(1)$$

Now, we need to find the area $g(1)$ enclosed by the tangent line, the curve $y=f(x)$, and the $y$-axis. This area can be expressed as the integral of the difference between the tangent line and the curve from $x=0$ to $x=t$:

$$g(t) = \int_{0}^{t} [(-t + e^{1-t^2})(x - t) + f(t) - f(x)] dx$$

To find $g(1)$, we substitute $t=1$ into the integral:

$$g(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [(e - 1)(x - 1) + f(1) - f(x)] dx$$

To find $g'(1)$, we differentiate $g(t)$ with respect to $t$ and then substitute $t=1$:

$$g'(t) = (-t + e^{1-t^2})(t - t) + f(t) - f(t) + \int_{0}^{t} [(-1 + 2te^{1-t^2})(x - t) - f'(x)] dx$$

Substituting $t=1$, we get:

$$g'(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [(e - 1)(x - 1) - f'(x)] dx$$

Finally, we can find $g(1) + g'(1)$ by adding the expressions for $g(1)$ and $g'(1)$:

$$g(1) + g'(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [(e - 1)(x - 1) + f(1) - f(x)] dx + \int_{0}^{1} [(e - 1)(x - 1) - f'(x)] dx$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$g(1) + g'(1) = \int_{0}^{1} [2(e - 1)(x - 1) + f(1) - f(x) - f'(x)] dx$$

Since we are not given the explicit form of $f(x)$, we cannot evaluate this integral directly. However, we can see that the value of $g(1) + g'(1)$ depends on the specific form of $f(x)$ and its derivative $f'(x)$. Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact value of $g(1) + g'(1)$.

문제 29:
Solution: Since $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (|a_n| + a_n) = \frac{40}{3}, \quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (|a_n| - a_n) = \frac{20}{3} $$,

it follows that $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| = \frac{30}{3} = 10, \quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \frac{10}{3} $$.

Therefore, $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n a_n = \frac{10}{3} - 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = -\frac{10}{3} $$.

Thus, $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{2n} ((-1)^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}} \times a_{m+k}) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} ((-1)^k a_{2m+2k-1} + (-1)^{k+1} a_{2m+2k}) $$

$$ = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} ((-1)^k a_{2m+2k-1} - (-1)^k a_{2m+2k}) $$

$$ = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k (a_{2m+2k-1} - a_{2m+2k}) $$

$$ = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k a_{2m+2k-1} - \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k a_{2m+2k} $$

$$ = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k a_{2m+2k-1} + \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1} a_{2m+2k} $$

$$ = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^k a_{m+k} $$

$$ = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{2k-1} a_{m+2k-1} + \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{2k} a_{m+2k} $$

$$ = -\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{m+2k-1} + \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{m+2k} $$

$$ = -\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{m+2k-1} + \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{m+2k} $$

$$ = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-a_{m+2k-1} + a_{m+2k}) $$

문제 30:
This problem involves calculus and trigonometry, and is significantly more complex than the previous examples. Let's break it down:

1. From $f(0) = 0$, we have $\sin(b) = 0$. This implies $b = k\pi$ for some integer $k$.

2. From $f(2\pi) = 2\pi a + b$, we have $\sin(2\pi a + k\pi + \sin(2\pi)) = 2\pi a + k\pi$. Since $\sin(2\pi) = 0$, this simplifies to $\sin(2\pi a + k\pi) = 2\pi a + k\pi$. Given $1 \leq a \leq 2$, the only solution is $a = 1$ and $k = 0$, so $b = 0$.

3. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = a\cos(ax + \sin x) + \cos(ax + \sin x)\cos x$. Setting $f'(0) = f'(t)$ gives $a + 1 = a\cos(at) + \cos(at)\cos t$. Since the smallest positive $t$ is $4\pi$, we have $a\cos(4\pi a) + \cos(4\pi a)\cos(4\pi) = a + 1$. This simplifies to $a + 1 = a + 1$, which is always true.

4. The condition for a local maximum at $x = \alpha$ is $f'(\alpha) = 0$. This gives $a\cos(a\alpha + \sin \alpha) + \cos(a\alpha + \sin \alpha)\cos \alpha = 0$. Since $a = 1$, this simplifies to $\cos(\alpha + \sin \alpha) + \cos \alpha \cos \alpha = 0$.

5. The solutions to this equation in the interval $(0, 4\pi)$ are $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \frac{7\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $n = 4$ and $\alpha_1 = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

6. Substituting $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $n = 4$, and $\alpha_1 = \frac{\pi}{2}$ into $n\alpha_1 - ab = \frac{q}{p}\pi$ gives $\frac{q}{p} = 2$. Therefore, $p = 1$ and $q = 2$.

The answer is $p + q = 3$.
