Problem 1:
Solution: Solution: To solve the given problem, we start by recognizing that the expression $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is the cube root of 25, which can be written as $\sqrt[3]{25}$. This is because any number raised to the power of $\frac{1}{n}$ is equivalent to taking the nth root of that number. Therefore, we have:

\[25^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{25}\]

Next, we observe that we have two cube roots, $\sqrt[3]{5}$ and $\sqrt[3]{25}$, which can be combined since they are both cube roots. The multiplication of their radicands follows the rule $a^m \times b^m = (a \times b)^m$. Applying this rule to our cube roots, we get:

\[\sqrt[3]{5} \times \sqrt[3]{25} = \sqrt[3]{5 \times 25}\]

Since $5 \times 25 = 125$, we can simplify the expression further:

\[\sqrt[3]{5 \times 25} = \sqrt[3]{125}\]

Finally, we recognize that the cube root of 125 is 5, because $5^3 = 125$. Therefore, the value of the given expression is:

\[\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{125} = 5\]

So, the final answer is $5$.
