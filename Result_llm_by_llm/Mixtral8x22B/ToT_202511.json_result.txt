Problem 1:
Solution: Solution: To solve the given problem, we start by recognizing that the expression $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is equivalent to the cube root of 25, which can be written as $\sqrt[3]{25}$. This is because any number raised to the power of $\frac{1}{n}$ is the nth root of that number. Therefore, we have:

\[25^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{25}\]

Next, we are given $\sqrt[3]{5}$ multiplied by $25^{\frac{1}{3}}$, which we now know is $\sqrt[3]{25}$. Using the property of radicals that allows us to multiply the expressions under the radical when they are of the same order, we can combine $\sqrt[3]{5}$ and $\sqrt[3]{25}$ as follows:

\[\sqrt[3]{5} \times \sqrt[3]{25} = \sqrt[3]{5 \times 25}\]

This step is based on the property that $\sqrt[n]{a} \times \sqrt[n]{b} = \sqrt[n]{a \times b}$.

Finally, we simplify the expression under the cube root, $\sqrt[3]{5 \times 25}$. Since $5 \times 25 = 125$, we have:

\[\sqrt[3]{5 \times 25} = \sqrt[3]{125}\]

And since 125 is a perfect cube (the cube of 5), the cube root of 125 is simply 5. Therefore, the value of the given expression is:

\[\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5\]

Answer: \(\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5\)
Answer: \(\sqrt[3]{5} \times 25^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5\)
